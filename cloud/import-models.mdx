    2. Generate your API key in the account settings.

3. Make sure your API keys have access permissions to the private models you want to import.

### 3. Import the private model

Once your API keys are configured, you can import private models using the same process as public models:

1. Get the model link from Hugging Face or Civitai (see [How to get model import links](#how-to-get-model-import-links) below).
2. Paste the link in the import modal.
3. The system will automatically use your saved API keys to access the private model.

<Note>
Make sure your API key has the necessary permissions to access the specific private model you want to import.
</Note>
