## Import private models

If you want to import private models from Hugging Face or Civitai, you need to configure your API keys first.

### 1. Save your API keys

1. Go to [Comfy Cloud Settings](https://cloud.comfy.org) and navigate to the **Secrets** section.
2. Add your API keys:
   - For Hugging Face: Add your Hugging Face API token (you can name the key anything you like)
   - For Civitai: Add your Civitai API key (you can name the key anything you like)
3. Make sure your API keys have access permissions to the private models you want to import.

### 2. Import the private model

Once your API keys are configured, you can import private models using the same process as public models:

1. Get the model link from Hugging Face or Civitai (see [How to get model import links](#how-to-get-model-import-links) below).
2. Paste the link in the import modal.
3. The system will automatically use your saved API keys to access the private model.

<Note>
Make sure your API key has the necessary permissions to access the specific private model you want to import.
