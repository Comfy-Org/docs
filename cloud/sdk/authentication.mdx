## API Keys

All Developer API requests require authentication via API key. These are the same API keys used for [Partner Nodes](/tutorials/partner-nodes/overview) and other Comfy platform features.

### Getting Your API Key

API keys are managed at [platform.comfy.org](https://platform.comfy.org/login):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit platform.comfy.org and Log In">
    Go to [platform.comfy.org/login](https://platform.comfy.org/login) and sign in with your Comfy account (Email, Google, or GitHub).
    ![Visit Platform Login Page](/images/interface/setting/user/user-login-api-key-1.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an API Key">
    Click **+ New** in the API Keys section.
    ![Create API Key](/images/interface/setting/user/user-login-api-key-2.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name Your Key">
    Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Backend", "Local Dev") and click **Generate**.
    ![Enter API Key Name](/images/interface/setting/user/user-login-api-key-3.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Your Key">
    Copy and save your API key immediately.

    <Warning>
      The API key is only shown once at creation. Store it securely - you cannot view it again later.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing API Keys

You can view and delete your API keys at [platform.comfy.org](https://platform.comfy.org/login):

![API Key Management](/images/interface/setting/user/user-login-api-key-5.jpg)

Delete any unused keys or keys that may have been compromised.

## Using Your API Key

Include the API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl https://cloud.comfy.org/developer/api/v1/account \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer comfyui-abc123..."
```

With the Python SDK:

```python
from comfy_cloud import ComfyCloudClient

client = ComfyCloudClient(api_key="comfyui-abc123...")
```

### Environment Variables

We recommend storing your API key in environment variables:

```bash
export COMFY_API_KEY="comfyui-abc123..."
```

```python
import os
from comfy_cloud import ComfyCloudClient

client = ComfyCloudClient(api_key=os.environ["COMFY_API_KEY"])
```

<Warning>
Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

## Environments

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| Production | `https://cloud.comfy.org/developer/api/v1` |
| Staging | `https://stagingcloud.comfy.org/developer/api/v1` |

```python
# Using staging
client = ComfyCloudClient(
    api_key="comfyui-...",
    base_url="https://stagingcloud.comfy.org/developer/api/v1",
)
```

## Rate Limits

The API has rate limits to ensure fair usage:

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Requests per minute | 600 |
| Concurrent jobs | Based on plan |
| Max upload size | 100 MB |

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic.

## Error Responses

Authentication errors return `401 Unauthorized`:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or expired API key"
  }
}
```

Common causes:
- Missing `Authorization` header
- Malformed header (should be `Bearer <key>`)
- Revoked or deleted API key
- Using wrong environment's key
