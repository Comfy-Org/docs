The ComfyUI Cloud Developer API provides a clean, SDK-friendly interface for running ComfyUI workflows programmatically. Use it to build applications, batch processing pipelines, or integrate AI image generation into your products.

## Why Use the Developer API?

## Core Concepts

### Resources

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Inputs** | Files you upload for use in workflows (images, masks, etc.) |
| **Models** | Custom models you bring (BYOM - Bring Your Own Model) |
| **Jobs** | Workflow executions |
| **Outputs** | Generated files from completed jobs |
| **Archives** | Bulk ZIP downloads of multiple job outputs |
| **Webhooks** | Event notifications to your server |

### Async Patterns

Many operations are asynchronous:

1. **Create** - Returns `202 Accepted` with resource in pending state
2. **Poll** - Check status until `ready` or `failed`
3. **Use** - Access the resource once ready

```python
# Example: Upload from URL (async operation)
input = client.inputs.from_url("https://example.com/image.png")
# Status is "downloading"

# Poll for completion
while input.status == "downloading":
    time.sleep(1)
    input = client.inputs.get(input.id)

# Now ready to use
print(input.name)  # Use this in your workflow
```

Or use WebSockets for real-time updates without polling.

## Quick Example

```python
from comfy_cloud import ComfyCloudClient

client = ComfyCloudClient(api_key="comfyui-...")

with client:
    # Run a workflow
    job = client.jobs.create(
        workflow={
            "3": {
                "class_type": "KSampler",
                "inputs": {"seed": 42, "steps": 20, ...}
            },
            # ... rest of workflow
        },
        tags=["my-app", "batch-1"],
    )
    
    # Wait for completion
    while job.status == "pending":
        job = client.jobs.get(job.id)
    
    # Get outputs
    outputs = client.outputs.list(job_id=job.id)
    for output in outputs.outputs:
        print(f"Download: {output.download_url}")
```
