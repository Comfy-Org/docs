## Getting Started with Hunyuan-Video

[Tencent](https://huggingface.co/tencent) has released open source video models for [text to video](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo), and [image to video](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V).

## Image to Video

Using Hunyuan I2V, you can transform still images into fluid, high-quality videos. Try this starting [frame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/hunyuan-video/i2v/robot-ballet.png).

### Unified Image & Video Architecture

The "Dual-stream to Single-stream" Transformer efficiently fuses text, images, and motion information, enhancing consistency, quality, and alignment across the generated video frames.

### Superior Text-Video-Image Alignment

The MLLM text encoder outperforms traditional encoders like CLIP and T5, offering better instruction following, detail capture, and complex reasoning when combined with image inputs.

### Efficient Video Compression

A custom 3D VAE compresses videos into a compact latent space, preserving resolution and frame rate while reducing tokens, making Image-to-Video generation more efficient.
