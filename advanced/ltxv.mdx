## Getting Started with LTX-Video

[LTX-Video](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video) is a very efficient video model by lightricks.

The important thing with this model is to give it long descriptive prompts.

Download the [ltx-video-2b-v0.9.5.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Lightricks/LTX-Video/resolve/main/ltx-video-2b-v0.9.5.safetensors?download=true) file and put it in your `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` folder.

If you don't have it already downloaded you can download the [t5xxl_fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/mochi_preview_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/text_encoders/t5xxl_fp16.safetensors?download=true) file and put it in your `ComfyUI/models/text_encoders` folder.

## Multi Frame Control 

Allows you to control the video with a series of images. You can download the input images: [starting frame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/ltxv/multi-frame/house1.png) and [ending frame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/ltxv/multi-frame/house2.png).
