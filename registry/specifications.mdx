# Node ID

The node id ("name" field in toml file) uniquely identifies the custom node, and will be used in URLs from the registry. Users can also install the node by referencing the name.

`comfy node install <node-id>`

The node id must be less than 50 characters and can only contain alphanumeric lowercase characters, hyphens, underscores, and periods. There should not be consequtive special characters and the id cannot start with a number or special character.
 
# Version Number

The registry uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) which indicates the specific release of a custom node through a three-digit version number X.Y.Z.  

X - **MAJOR** change that breaks previous updates

Y - **MINOR** change that adds new features and is backwards compatible

Z - **PATCH** change that fixes a bug  

# License

An optional field that expects a relative path to your license file (usually named `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.txt`). 
- `license = { file = "LICENSE" }` ✅
- `license = "LICENSE"` ❌

Alternatively, it can also be referenced by name. Common licenses include [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit), [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), or [Apache](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
- `license = {text = "MIT License"}` ✅
