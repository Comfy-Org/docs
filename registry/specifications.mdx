# Specifications

The `pyproject.toml` file contains two main sections for ComfyUI custom nodes: `[project]` and `[tool.comfy]`. Below are the specifications for each section.

## [project] Section

### name (required)
The node id uniquely identifies the custom node and will be used in URLs from the registry. Users can install the node by referencing this name:

```bash
comfy node install <node-id>
```

**Requirements:**
- Must be less than 100 characters
- Can only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and periods
- Cannot have consecutive special characters
- Cannot start with a number or special character
- Case-insensitive comparison

**Best Practices:**
- Use a short, descriptive name
- Don't include "ComfyUI" in the name
- Make it memorable and easy to type

**Examples:**
```toml
name = "image-processor"      # ✅ Good: Simple and clear
name = "super-resolution"     # ✅ Good: Describes functionality
name = "ComfyUI-enhancer"    # ❌ Bad: Includes ComfyUI
name = "123-tool"            # ❌ Bad: Starts with number
```

See the official [python documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/#name) for more details.

### version (required)
Uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with a three-digit version number X.Y.Z:

- X (**MAJOR**): Breaking changes
- Y (**MINOR**): New features (backwards compatible)
- Z (**PATCH**): Bug fixes

**Examples:**
```toml
version = "1.0.0"    # Initial release
version = "1.1.0"    # Added new features
version = "1.1.1"    # Bug fix
version = "2.0.0"    # Breaking changes
```

### license (optional)
Specifies the license for your custom node. Can be specified in two ways:

1. **File Reference:**
```toml
license = { file = "LICENSE" }     # ✅ Points to LICENSE file
license = { file = "LICENSE.txt" } # ✅ Points to LICENSE.txt
license = "LICENSE"                # ❌ Incorrect format
```

2. **License Name:**
```toml
license = { text = "MIT License" }  # ✅ Correct format
license = { text = "Apache-2.0" }   # ✅ Correct format
license = "MIT LICENSE"             # ❌ Incorrect format
```

Common licenses: [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit), [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), [Apache](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

### description (recommended)
A brief description of what your custom node does.

```toml
description = "A super resolution node for enhancing image quality"
```

### urls (recommended)
Links to related resources:

```toml
[project.urls]
Repository = "https://github.com/username/repository"
Documentation = "https://github.com/username/repository/wiki"
"Bug Tracker" = "https://github.com/username/repository/issues"
```

### requires-python (recommended)
Specifies the Python versions that your node supports:

```toml
requires-python = ">=3.8"        # Python 3.8 or higher
requires-python = ">=3.8,<3.11"  # Python 3.8 up to (but not including) 3.11
```

### classifiers (recommended)
Use classifiers to specify operating system compatibility and other metadata. The most relevant classifiers for operating systems are:

```toml
[project]
classifiers = [
    # For OS-independent nodes (works on all operating systems)
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",

    # OR for OS-specific nodes, specify the supported systems:
    "Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows",  # Windows specific
    "Operating System :: POSIX :: Linux",  # Linux specific
    "Operating System :: MacOS",  # macOS specific
    
    # You can be more specific if needed
    "Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows :: Windows 10",
    "Operating System :: POSIX :: Linux :: Ubuntu",
    "Operating System :: MacOS :: MacOS X",
]
```

**Common Combinations:**
```toml
# For nodes that work on all operating systems
classifiers = [
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]

# For Windows-only nodes
classifiers = [
    "Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows",
    "Operating System :: Microsoft :: Windows :: Windows 10",
]

# For specific OS combinations (e.g., Linux and macOS only)
classifiers = [
    "Operating System :: POSIX :: Linux",
    "Operating System :: MacOS",
]
```

See the full list of valid classifiers on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/classifiers/).

## [tool.comfy] Section

### PublisherId (required)
Your unique publisher identifier, typically matching your GitHub username.

**Examples:**
```toml
PublisherId = "john-doe"        # ✅ Matches GitHub username
PublisherId = "image-wizard"    # ✅ Unique identifier
```

### DisplayName (optional)
A user-friendly name for your custom node.

```toml
DisplayName = "Super Resolution Node"
```

### Icon (optional)
URL to your custom node's icon.

**Requirements:**
- File types: SVG, PNG, JPG, or GIF
- Maximum resolution: 800px × 400px

```toml
Icon = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/icon.png"
```
