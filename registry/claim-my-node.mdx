## Overview

The **Claim My Node** feature allows developers to claim ownership of custom nodes in the ComfyUI Registry. This system ensures that only the rightful authors can manage and update their published nodes, providing security and accountability within the community.

## What are Unclaimed Nodes?

As we migrate from ComfyUI Manager to the Comfy Registry with new standards, many custom nodes that were previously listed in the ComfyUI Manager legacy system now appear as "unclaimed" in the registry. These are nodes that:

- Were originally published in the ComfyUI Manager legacy system
- Have been migrated to the Comfy Registry to meet the latest standards
- Are waiting for their original authors to claim ownership

We provide an easy way for developers to claim these migrated nodes, ensuring a smooth transition from the legacy system to the new registry standard while maintaining proper ownership and control.

## Getting Started

To claim your nodes:

1. **Navigate to Your Unclaimed Node Page**: Visit your unclaimed node page, Click "Claim my node!" button.

2. **Create a Publisher (if you don't have one yet)**:
   - If you haven't created a publisher yet, you'll be prompted to create one. A publisher is required to claim nodes and manage them effectively.

3. **Select a Publisher**: Choose the publisher under which you want to claim the node. this step will redirect you to the claim page.
