title: "Custom Node CI/CD"
---

## Introduction

When making changes to custom nodes, it's not uncommon to break things in Comfy or other custom nodes. It is often unrealistic to test on every operating system and different configurations of Pytorch. 

### Run Comfy Workflows using Github Actions

[Comfy-Action](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/comfy-action) allows you to run a Comfy workflow.json file on Github Actions. It supports downloading models, custom nodes, and runs on Linux/Mac/Windows.

### Results

Output files are uploaded to the [CI/CD Dashboard](https://comfyci.org) and can be viewed as a last step before committing new changes or publishing new versions of the custom node.
