## Introduction

The Registry is a public collection of custom nodes. Developers can publish, version, deprecate, and track metrics related to their custom nodes. ComfyUI users can discover, install, and rate custom nodes from the registry.

## Why use the Registry?

The Comfy Registry helps the community by standardizing the development of custom nodes:

- Canonical Names: A custom node on the Registry has a globally unique name and this allows Comfy Workflow JSON files to uniquely identify any custom node without collisions.

- Immutability: Once a custom node version is published, it cannot be changed. This ensures that users can rely on the stability of the custom node over time.

- Semantic Versioning: Custom nodes are versioned using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This allows users to understand the impact of upgrading to a new version.

## Publishing to the Registry

### Create a Publisher

A publisher is an identity that can publish custom nodes to the registry. Every custom node needs to include a publisher identifier in the pyproject.toml [file]().

Go to [Comfy Registry](https://comfyregistry.org), and create a publisher account. Your publisher id is globally unique, and cannot be changed later because it is used in the URL of your custom node.


### Create an API Key for publishing

Go [here](https://comfyregistry.org/nodes) and click on the publisher you want to create an API key for. This will be used to publish a custom node via the CLI.

Name the API key and save it somewhere.

<Warning> We recommend you save the API Key in your Github Repository Secrets and use our [Github Action](https://github.com/robinjhuang/publish-node-action) to automate publishing.</Warning>

### Add Metadata

<Info>**Install the cli:** ```pip install comfy-cli```. [More info](/comfy-cli/getting-started). </Info>

```bash
comfy node init
```

This command will generate the following metadata:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "" # Unique identifier for your node. Immutable after creation.
description = ""
version = "1.0.0" # Custom Node version. Must be semantically versioned.
dependencies  = [] # Filled in from requirements.txt

[project.urls]
Repository = "https://github.com/..."

[tool.comfy]
PublisherId = "" # TODO (fill in Publisher ID from Comfy Registry Website).
DisplayName = "" # Display name for the Custom Node. Can be changed later.
Icon = "images/icon.png"
```

Add this file to your repository. Check the [specifications](/registry/specifications) for more information on the pyproject.toml file.

### Publish to the Registry

```bash
comfy node publish

API Key for publisher '<publisher id>': ****************************************************

...Version 1.0.0 Published. 
See it here: https://comfyregistry.com/publisherId/your-node
```

### Review custom node installs and ratings

Track installs over time. See how many users have installed your custom node and how many have rated it.


### Deprecate a version

You can deprecate a version in the Comfy Registry website by clicking **More Actions > Deprecate**. Users who installed this version will be shown the deprecation message and be encouraged to upgrade to a newer version.

Deprecating versions is useful when an issue is discovered after publishing.
