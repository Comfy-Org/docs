## Introduction

The Registry is a public collection of custom nodes. Developers can publish, version, deprecate, and track metrics related to their custom nodes. ComfyUI users can discover, install, and rate custom nodes from the registry.

## Why use the Registry?

The Comfy Registry helps the community by standardizing the development of custom nodes:

<Icon icon="timeline" iconType="solid" size={20}/>&nbsp; **Node Versioning:** Developers frequently publish new versions of their custom nodes which often break workflows that rely on them. With registry nodes being [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/), users can now choose to safely upgrade, deprecate, or lock their node versions in place, knowing in advance how their actions will impact their workflows. The workflow JSON will store the version of the node used, so you can always reliably reproduce your workflows.

<Icon icon="shield" iconType="solid" size={20}/>&nbsp; **Node Security:** The registry will serve as a backend for the [ComfyUI-manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager). All nodes will be scanned for malicious behaviour such as custom pip wheels, arbitrary system calls, etc. Nodes that pass these checks will have a verification flag (<Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" />) beside their name on the UI-manager. For a list of security standards, see the [standards](/registry/standards).

## Understanding Different API Keys in ComfyUI

ComfyUI uses different types of API keys for different purposes. It's important to understand the distinction:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Registry Publishing API Key" icon="upload">
    **Purpose:** Used by custom node developers to publish and update their nodes to the Comfy Registry.
    
    **Where to find it:** Go to [Comfy Registry](https://registry.comfy.org/nodes), click on your publisher name, and create an API key.
    
    **Used for:** Publishing custom nodes via `comfy node publish` command or GitHub Actions.
    
    **Documentation:** [Publishing Nodes](/registry/publishing)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ComfyUI Account API Key" icon="key">
    **Purpose:** Used to authenticate your ComfyUI account and access paid API nodes (external models) in workflows.
    
    **Where to find it:** Login to [ComfyUI Platform](https://platform.comfy.org/login) and generate an API key from your account settings.
    
    **Used for:** Running workflows with API nodes in headless mode or custom frontends, accessing paid external models.
    
    **Documentation:** [API Key Integration](/development/comfyui-server/api-key-integration) and [API Nodes Overview](/tutorials/api-nodes/overview)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="ComfyUI Server API" icon="server">
    **Purpose:** ComfyUI's native REST API for remote workflow execution and server control.
    
    **Where to find it:** This is the built-in HTTP API that ComfyUI provides on port 8188 by default.
    
    **Used for:** Programmatically submitting workflows, monitoring execution, and controlling ComfyUI remotely.
    
    **Documentation:** [ComfyUI Server Communication](/development/comfyui-server/comms_overview)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  **Don't confuse these!** The Registry Publishing API Key is only for publishing custom nodes. To use paid API nodes in your workflows, you need a ComfyUI Account API Key instead.
</Warning>

## Publishing Nodes

Get started publishing your first node by following the [tutorial](/registry/publishing).

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do registry nodes have unique identifiers?">
    Yes, a custom node on the Registry has a globally unique name and this allows Comfy Workflow JSON files to uniquely identify any custom node without collisions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there any restrictions on what I can publish?">
    Check the [standards](/registry/standards) for more information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you ensure node stability?">
    Once a custom node version is published, it cannot be changed. This ensures that users can rely on the stability of the custom node over time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are nodes versioned?">
    Custom nodes are versioned using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This allows users to understand the impact of upgrading to a new version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I deprecate a node version?">
    You can deprecate a version in the Comfy Registry website by clicking **More Actions > Deprecate**. Users who installed this version will be shown the deprecation message and be encouraged to upgrade to a newer version.

    Deprecating versions is useful when an issue is discovered after publishing.
