### Make publishing versions as part of your CI/CD pipeline

We wrote a [Github Action](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/node-publish-action) that will publish versions for your custom node. This action will publish a new version of your custom node to the Comfy Registry and can be configured depending on your desired developer workflow.



#### Publishing when changing pyproject.toml

```yaml


```


#### Publishing when a new release is created

```yaml


```


#### Publishing manually

```yaml

```
