# Overview

ComfyUI is a powerful GenAI inference engine that can be used to run AI models locally, create workflows, develop custom nodes, and be deployed as a server.

ComfyUI's key capabilities are:

- **Creating Workflows**: Workflows are a way to orchestrate AI models and automate tasks. They are a series of nodes that are connected together to form a pipeline. [Learn more](/development/core-concepts/workflow)
- **Custom Nodes**: Custom nodes can be written by anyone to extend the capabilities of ComfyUI for your own use. Nodes are written in Python and are published by the community. [Learn more](/development/core-concepts/nodes)
- **Extensions**: Extensions are 3rd party applications that improve the UI of ComfyUI.
- **Deployment**: ComfyUI can be deployed in your own environment as an API endpoint. [Learn more](/development/comfyui-server/comms-overview)
