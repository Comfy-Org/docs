title: "Custom Node Registry"
---

## Introduction

The registry allows custom node authors to version, deprecate, and track metrics related to their custom node.

## Publishing to the Registry

### Create a Publisher

A publisher is an identity that can publish custom nodes to the registry. Every custom node needs to include a publisher identifier in the pyproject.toml [file]().

Go to [Comfy Registry](), and create a publisher account. You will need to verify your email address.


### Create a Personal Access Token

Create a personal access token [here](). This will be used to publish a custom node via the CLI. 

### Metadata

```bash
comfy node init
```

This command will generate the following metadata:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
name = "" # Unique identifier for your node. Immutable after creation.
description = ""
version = "1.0.0" # Custom Node version. Must be semantically versioned.
dependencies  = [] # Filled in from requirements.txt

[project.urls]
Repository = "https://github.com/me/node.git"
Issues = "https://github.com/me/node/issues"

[tool.comfy]
PublisherId = "" # Publisher ID from Comfy Registry Website.
DisplayName = "" # Display name for the Custom Node. Can be changed.
Icon = "images/icon.png"
Comfy-Version = ">= 0.1.0" # The minimum version of Comfy required by custom node.
```

### Publish to the Registry

```bash
comfy node publish

Personal Access Token for publisher '<publisher id>': ****************************************************

...Version 1.0.0 Published. 
See it here: https://comfyregistry.com/publisherId/your-node
```

### Review custom node installs and ratings

Track installs over time. See how many users have installed your custom node and how many have rated it.

### Auto-increment version

When publishing a custom node, you can auto-increment its version number by specifying the SemVer-compatible number or version (major, minor, or patch) to increment. For example, to update an extension's version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0, you would specify:

```bash
comfy node publish minor
```

### Deprecate a version

You can deprecate a version in the [Comfy Registry]() website by clicking **More Actions > Deprecate**. Users who install this version will be show the deprecation message and be encouraged to upgrade to a newer version.

Deprecating versions is useful when an issue is discovered after publishing.
