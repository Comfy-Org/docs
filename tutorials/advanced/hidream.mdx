![HiDream-I1 Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1/main/assets/demo.jpg)

HiDream-I1 is a text-to-image model officially open-sourced by HiDream-ai on April 7, 2025. The model has 17B parameters and is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1/blob/main/LICENSE), supporting personal projects, scientific research, and commercial use. 
It currently performs excellently in multiple benchmark tests.

## Model Features

**Hybrid Architecture Design**
A combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture:
- Based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT), with dual-stream MMDiT modules processing multimodal information and single-stream DiT modules optimizing global consistency.
- Dynamic routing mechanism flexibly allocates computing resources, enhancing complex scene processing capabilities and delivering excellent performance in color restoration, edge processing, and other details.

**Multimodal Text Encoder Integration**
Integrates four text encoders:
- OpenCLIP ViT-bigG, OpenAI CLIP ViT-L (visual semantic alignment)
- T5-XXL (long text parsing)
- Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (instruction understanding)
This combination achieves SOTA performance in complex semantic parsing of colors, quantities, spatial relationships, etc., with Chinese prompt support significantly outperforming similar open-source models.

**Original Model Versions**

HiDream-ai provides three versions of the HiDream-I1 model to meet different needs. Below are the links to the original model repositories:

| Model Name      | Description    | Inference Steps | Repository Link                                                        |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HiDream-I1-Full | Full version   | 50              | [ðŸ¤— HiDream-I1-Full](https://huggingface.co/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1-Full)|
| HiDream-I1-Dev  | Distilled dev  | 28              | [ðŸ¤— HiDream-I1-Dev](https://huggingface.co/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1-Dev)  |

## About This Workflow Example

In this example, we will use the repackaged version from ComfyOrg. You can find all the model files we'll use in this example in the [HiDream-I1_ComfyUI](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/HiDream-I1_ComfyUI/) repository.

<Tip>
Before starting, please update your ComfyUI version to ensure it's at least after this [commit](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/commit/9ad792f92706e2179c58b2e5348164acafa69288) to make sure your ComfyUI has native support for HiDream
</Tip>

## HiDream-I1 Workflow

The model requirements for different ComfyUI native HiDream-I1 workflows are basically the same, with only the [diffusion models](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/HiDream-I1_ComfyUI/tree/main/split_files/diffusion_models) files being different.

If you don't know which version to choose, please refer to the following suggestions:

- **HiDream-I1-Full** can generate the highest quality images
- **HiDream-I1-Dev** balances high-quality image generation with speed
- **HiDream-I1-Fast** can generate images in just 16 steps, suitable for scenarios requiring real-time iteration

For the **dev** and **fast** versions, negative prompts are not needed, so please set the `cfg` parameter to `1.0` during sampling. We have noted the corresponding parameter settings in the relevant workflows.

<Tip>
The full versions of all three versions require a lot of VRAM - you may need more than 27GB of VRAM to run them smoothly. In the corresponding workflow tutorials,
we will use the **fp8** version as a demonstration example to ensure that most users can run it smoothly.
However, we will still provide download links for different versions of the model in the corresponding examples, and you can choose the appropriate file based on your VRAM situation.
</Tip>

### Model Installation
