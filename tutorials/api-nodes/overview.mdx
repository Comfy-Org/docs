API Nodes are ComfyUI's new way of calling closed-source models through API requests, providing ComfyUI users with access to external state-of-the-art AI models without complex API key setup.

## What are API Nodes?

API Nodes are a set of special nodes that connect to external API services, allowing you to use closed-source or third-party hosted AI models directly in your ComfyUI workflows. These nodes are designed to seamlessly integrate the capabilities of external models while maintaining the open-source nature of ComfyUI's core.

Currently supported models include:

## Log in with API Key on non-whitelisted websites

Currently, we have set up a whitelist to restrict the websites where you can log in to your ComfyUI account.
If you need to log in to your ComfyUI account on some non-whitelisted websites, please refer to the account management section to learn how to log in using an API Key.
In this case, the corresponding website does not need to be on our whitelist.

## Use ComfyUI API Key Integration to call paid model API nodes

Currently, we support accessing our services through ComfyUI API Key Integration to call paid model API nodes. Please refer to the API Key Integration section to learn how to use API Key Integration to call paid model API nodes.

<Note>
  **Important:** The API key discussed here is your **ComfyUI Account API Key** (used for accessing paid API nodes in workflows). This is **NOT** the same as the **Registry Publishing API Key** used by developers to publish custom nodes to the registry. If you're looking to publish custom nodes, see [Publishing Nodes](/registry/publishing).

## Advantages of API Nodes

API Nodes provide several important advantages for ComfyUI users:

- **Access to closed-source models**: Use state-of-the-art AI models without having to deploy them yourself
- **Seamless integration**: API nodes are fully compatible with other ComfyUI nodes and can be combined to create complex workflows
- **Simplified experience**: No need to manage API keys or handle complex API requests
- **Controlled costs**: The prepaid system ensures you have complete control over your spending with no unexpected charges

## About Open Source and Opt-in

It's important to note that **API Nodes are completely optional**. ComfyUI will always remain fully open-source and free for local users. API nodes are designed as an "opt-in" feature, providing convenience for those who want access to external SOTA (state-of-the-art) models.

## Use Cases

A powerful application of API Nodes is combining the output of external models with local nodes. For example:

- Using GPT-Image-1 to generate a base image, then transforming it into video with a local `wan` node
- Combining externally generated images with local upscaling or style transfer nodes
- Creating hybrid workflows that leverage the advantages of both closed-source and open-source models

This flexibility makes ComfyUI a truly universal generative AI interface, integrating various AI capabilities into a unified workflow, opening up more possibilities
