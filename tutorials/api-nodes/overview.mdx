API Nodes are ComfyUI's new way of calling closed-source models through API requests, providing ComfyUI users with access to external state-of-the-art AI models without complex API key setup.

## What are API Nodes?

API Nodes are a set of special nodes that connect to external API services, allowing you to use closed-source or third-party hosted AI models directly in your ComfyUI workflows. These nodes are designed to seamlessly integrate the capabilities of external models while maintaining the open-source nature of ComfyUI's core.

Currently supported models include:
- **OpenAI GPT-Image-1** - The same model used for ChatGPT 4o image generation
- More models coming soon...

## How to Use API Nodes

Using API Nodes requires a few simple steps:

1. **Find the API nodes**: You can find them under the **"API Nodes"** category in the node menu, or through the search function
2. **[Log in](/interface/user)**: Using API nodes requires you to log in to your Comfy Org account, which you can access in the settings menu under the `User` section
3. **[Credits](/interface/credits)**: API calls use a prepaid system, you can purchase credits in `Settings` â†’ `Credits`
4. **Add to workflow**: Add API nodes to your workflow just like any other node
5. **Run**: After setting the parameters, run your workflow

## Advantages of API Nodes

API Nodes provide several important advantages for ComfyUI users:

- **Access to closed-source models**: Use state-of-the-art AI models without having to deploy them yourself
- **Seamless integration**: API nodes are fully compatible with other ComfyUI nodes and can be combined to create complex workflows
- **Simplified experience**: No need to manage API keys or handle complex API requests
- **Controlled costs**: The prepaid system ensures you have complete control over your spending with no unexpected charges


## About Open Source and Opt-in

It's important to note that **API Nodes are completely optional**. ComfyUI will always remain fully open-source and free for local users. API nodes are designed as an "opt-in" feature, providing convenience for those who want access to external SOTA (state-of-the-art) models.

## Use Cases

A powerful application of API Nodes is combining the output of external models with local nodes. For example:

- Using GPT-Image-1 to generate a base image, then transforming it into video with a local `wan` node
- Combining externally generated images with local upscaling or style transfer nodes
- Creating hybrid workflows that leverage the advantages of both closed-source and open-source models

This flexibility makes ComfyUI a truly universal generative AI interface, integrating various AI capabilities into a unified workflow, opening up more possibilities
