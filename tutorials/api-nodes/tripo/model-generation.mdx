Tripo AI is a company focused on generative AI 3D modeling. It provides user-friendly platforms and API services that can quickly convert text prompts or 2D images (single or multiple) into high-quality 3D models.
ComfyUI has now natively integrated the corresponding Tripo API, allowing you to conveniently use the related nodes in ComfyUI for model generation.

Currently, ComfyUI's API nodes support the following Tripo model generation capabilities:
- Text-to-model
- Image-to-model
- Multi-view model generation
- Rig model
- Retarget rigged model

## Text-to-Model Workflow

### 1. Workflow File Download

Download the file below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow.

<a className="prose"  target='_blank'  href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/api_nodes/tripo/api_tripo_text_to_model.json" style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#0078D6', color: '#ffffff', padding: '10px 20px', borderRadius: '8px', borderColor: "transparent", textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
    <p className="prose" style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: "0.8rem" }}>Download Json Format Workflow File</p>
</a>

### 2. Complete the Workflow Execution Step by Step

![ComfyUI Tripo Text to Model Step Guide](/images/tutorial/api_nodes/tripo/tripo_text_to_model_step_guide.jpg)

You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic text-to-model workflow execution:  
1. In the `Tripo: Text to Model` node, input your prompt in the `prompt` field
   - model: You can select different models, currently only v1.4 model supports subsequent optimization with `Tripo: Refine Draft model`
   - style: You can set different styles
   - texture_quality: You can set different texture qualities
2. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute model generation. After the workflow completes, the corresponding model will be automatically saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory
3. In the `Preview 3D` node, click to expand the menu
4. Select `Export` to directly export the corresponding model

## Image-to-Model Workflow

### 1. Workflow File Download

Download the file below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow.

### 2. Complete the Workflow Execution Step by Step

![ComfyUI Tripo Text to Model Step Guide](/images/tutorial/api_nodes/tripo/tripo_image_to_model_step_guide.jpg)

You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic image-to-model workflow execution:  
1. In the `Load Image` node, load the provided input image
2. In the `Tripo: Image to Model` node, modify the corresponding parameter settings
   - model: You can select different models, currently only v1.4 model supports subsequent optimization with `Tripo: Refine Draft model`
   - style: You can set different styles
   - texture_quality: You can set different texture qualities
3. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute model generation. After the workflow completes, the corresponding model will be automatically saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory
4. For model download, please refer to the instructions in the text-to-model section


## Multi-view Model Generation Workflow

### 1. Workflow File Download

Download the file below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow.

<a className="prose"  target='_blank'  href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/api_nodes/tripo/multiview_to_image/api_tripo_multiview_to_model.json" style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#0078D6', color: '#ffffff', padding: '10px 20px', borderRadius: '8px', borderColor: "transparent", textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
    <p className="prose" style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: "0.8rem" }}>Download Json Format Workflow File</p>

Download the images below as input images

![Front View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/api_nodes/tripo/multiview_to_image/front.jpg)
![Back View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/api_nodes/tripo/multiview_to_image/back.jpg)

### 2. Complete the Workflow Execution Step by Step

![ComfyUI Tripo Text to Model Step Guide](/images/tutorial/api_nodes/tripo/tripo_multiview_to_model_step_guide.jpg)

You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic multi-view to model workflow execution:  
1. In the `Load Image` nodes, load the provided input images respectively
2. In the `Tripo: Image to Model` node, modify the corresponding parameter settings
   - model: You can select different models, currently only v1.4 model supports subsequent optimization with `Tripo: Refine Draft model`
   - style: You can set different styles
   - texture_quality: You can set different texture qualities
3. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute model generation. After the workflow completes, the corresponding model will be automatically saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory
4. For other view inputs, you can refer to the step diagram and set the corresponding node mode to `Always` to enable it
5. For model download, please refer to the instructions in the text-to-model section

##  Subsequent Task Processing for the Same Task

Tripo's corresponding nodes provide subsequent processing for the same task, you only need to input the corresponding `model_task_id` in the relevant nodes, and we have also provided the corresponding nodes in the relevant templates, you can also modify the corresponding node mode as needed to enable it

<Error>
    The `Tripo: Refine Draft model` node only supports V1.4 model, other models do not support it
</Error>
