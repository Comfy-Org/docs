You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic text-to-image workflow execution:  
1. In the `Runway Text to Image` node, input your prompt in the `prompt` field
2. (Optional) Adjust the `ratio` setting to set different output aspect ratios
3. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute image generation.
4. After waiting for the API to return results, you can view the generated image in the `Save Image` node (right-click to save). The corresponding image will also be saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory.
