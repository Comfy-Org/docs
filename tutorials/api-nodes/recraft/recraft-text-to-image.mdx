The [Recraft Text to Image](/built-in-nodes/api-node/image/recraft/recraft-text-to-image) node allows you to create high-quality images in various styles using Recraft AI's image generation technology based on text descriptions.

In this guide, we'll show you how to set up a text-to-image workflow using this node.

## Recraft Text to Image API Node Workflow

### 1. Download the Workflow File

The workflow information is included in the metadata of the image below. Download and drag it into ComfyUI to load the workflow.

### 2. Follow the Steps to Run the Workflow

![Recraft Text to Image Workflow Steps](/images/tutorial/api_nodes/recraft/recraft_t2v_step_guide.jpg)

Follow these numbered steps to run the basic workflow:
1. (Optional) Change the `Recraft Color RGB` in the `Color` node to your desired color
2. (Optional) Modify the `Recraft Style` node to control the visual style, such as digital art, realistic photo, or logo design. This group includes other style nodes you can enable as needed
3. (Optional) Edit the `prompt` parameter in the `Recraft Text to Image` node. You can also change the `size` parameter
4. Click the `Run` button or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to generate the image
5. After the API returns the result, you can view the generated image in the `Save Image` node. The image will also be saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory

> (Optional) We've included a **Convert to SVG** group in the workflow. Since the `Recraft Vectorize Image` node in this group consumes additional credits, enable it only when you need to convert the generated image to SVG format

### 3. Additional Notes

- **Recraft Style**: Offers various preset styles like realistic photos, digital art, and logo designs
- **Seed Parameter**: Only used to determine if the node should run again, the actual generation result is not affected by the seed value
