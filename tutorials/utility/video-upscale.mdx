## TL;DR

- **Quality mode**: SeedVR2 and HitPaw deliver the most accurate and consistent realism.
- **Speed mode**: FlashVSR and HitPaw are the fastest options.
- **AI video fix**: Topaz Astra Creative is strongest for cinematic polish and fixing AI-generated video.
- **Archival restoration**: SeedVR2 preserves original structure while enhancing clarity.
- **CGI/3D render**: Topaz, SeedVR2, and HitPaw all produce clean, sharp results.

## Key concepts

### Upscaling vs. enhancement

- **Upscaling** increases resolution while reconstructing detail.
- **Enhancement** improves perceived quality (denoise, sharpen, restore, temporal consistency, etc.).

Video upscaling adds temporal considerations—maintaining consistency across frames while improving resolution.

### Creative vs. conservative upscale

| | Conservative | Creative |
|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Preserve the original | Reimagine and enhance |
| **Strengths** | High accuracy, temporal consistency, production-safe | Rich details, sharper, more visually striking |
| **Limits** | Can appear flat, limited improvement on poor input | Possible hallucinations, temporal flickering |
| **Models** | Topaz Starlight Fast, FlashVSR, SeedVR2, HitPaw | Topaz Starlight Creative (Astra), Wan 2.2, HitPaw |

## Use cases

### Quality mode

**SeedVR2** and **HitPaw** deliver the most accurate results, with strong image quality and excellent character consistency.

**Topaz** also upscales effectively, but it can sometimes be more creative than expected. This makes it especially suitable for cinematic footage where a stylized look is acceptable.

### Speed mode

**FlashVSR** performs extremely well when speed is the priority. Upscaling from 720p to 1080p takes about **41 seconds for a 10-second video**, making it one of the fastest options available.

**HitPaw** is also relatively fast. In **Topaz**, the Fast and Creative modes render at similar speeds, so using **Creative** mode is generally recommended for better visual results without sacrificing time.

### AI video fix

**Topaz Astra Creative** produces very smooth and visually consistent outputs, making it a strong choice for repairing AI-generated videos.

A useful workflow tip is to first run a **fix or cleanup pass**, then upscale to **1080p**, and finally upscale gradually to **4K**. This step-by-step approach usually leads to better stability and detail.

### Topaz Video Enhance features

- **Upscaling**: Starlight (Astra) supports fast video upscaling to FullHD (1080p) or 4K while maintaining clarity.
- **Interpolation**: Apollo model for frame interpolation with slowmo settings and custom frame rates (e.g., 60fps).
- **Dynamic compression**: Intelligently identifies and handles compression artifacts to improve image purity.

## Getting started with Topaz Video Enhance

1. Update ComfyUI to the latest version.
2. Search for the `Topaz Video Enhance` node in the node list.
3. Connect your video input and configure the settings.
4. Run the workflow.

## Tips

- Combine upscaling with [frame interpolation](/tutorials/utility/frame-interpolation) for smoother, higher-resolution output.
- For AI-generated videos, consider fixing artifacts before upscaling rather than relying on creative upscaling to fix them.
- Test different models on sample clips before processing full videos.
- Use conservative upscaling for content that requires strict fidelity to the original.
