## Key concepts

### Upscaling vs. enhancement

- **Upscaling** increases resolution while reconstructing detail.
- **Enhancement** improves perceived quality (denoise, sharpen, restore, temporal consistency, etc.).

Video upscaling adds temporal considerations—maintaining consistency across frames while improving resolution.

### Creative vs. conservative upscale

| | Conservative | Creative |
|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Preserve the original | Reimagine and enhance |
| **Strengths** | High accuracy, temporal consistency, production-safe | Rich details, sharper, more visually striking |
| **Limits** | Can appear flat, limited improvement on poor input | Possible hallucinations, temporal flickering |
| **Models** | Topaz Starlight Fast, FlashVSR | Topaz Starlight Creative (Astra), Wan 2.2 |

## Use cases

### Film and VFX

Professional productions require consistent, artifact-free upscaling that preserves the original creative intent.

**Recommended**: Topaz Starlight Fast for precision, Topaz Starlight Creative (Astra) for enhanced detail.

### Social media content

Quick turnaround with visually striking results. Creative upscaling can add punch to lower-resolution source material.

**Recommended**: Topaz Starlight Creative (Astra)

### Archival footage restoration

Older footage benefits from both upscaling and enhancement to reduce noise and improve clarity while maintaining the original character.

**Recommended**: Topaz Video Enhance with compression artifact handling

### AI-generated video

AI-generated videos often have resolution limitations and compression artifacts. Upscaling can improve quality for final delivery.

**Recommended**: Conservative models to avoid amplifying AI artifacts

### Animation and motion graphics

Clean lines and consistent colors are essential. Conservative upscaling preserves the intended style.

**Recommended**: Topaz Starlight Fast

## Available models

### Partner nodes

Partner nodes provide access to advanced video upscaling models via API.

| Model | Type | Max resolution | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Topaz Starlight Fast | Conservative | 4K | Fast, precision upscale |
| Topaz Starlight Creative (Astra) | Creative | 4K | Diffusion-based creative upscale |
| Topaz Apollo | - | - | Frame interpolation |

### Topaz Video Enhance features

- **Upscaling**: Starlight (Astra) supports fast video upscaling to FullHD (1080p) or 4K while maintaining clarity.
- **Interpolation**: Apollo model for frame interpolation with slowmo settings and custom frame rates (e.g., 60fps).
- **Dynamic compression**: Intelligently identifies and handles compression artifacts to improve image purity.

## Getting started with Topaz Video Enhance

1. Update ComfyUI to the latest version.
2. Search for the `Topaz Video Enhance` node in the node list.
3. Connect your video input and configure the settings.
4. Run the workflow.

## Tips

- Combine upscaling with [frame interpolation](/tutorials/utility/frame-interpolation) for smoother, higher-resolution output.
- For AI-generated videos, consider fixing artifacts before upscaling rather than relying on creative upscaling to fix them.
- Test different models on sample clips before processing full videos.
- Use conservative upscaling for content that requires strict fidelity to the original.
