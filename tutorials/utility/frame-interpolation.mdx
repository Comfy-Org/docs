## What is frame interpolation?

<Note>
This workflow contains custom nodes. You need to install them using [ComfyUI Manager](/comfyui/custom-nodes/comfyui-manager) before running the workflow.
</Note>

Frame interpolation generates intermediate frames between existing frames, resulting in smoother motion and improved temporal consistency. This technique is essential for video post-processing and can significantly improve the quality of generated videos.

## Use cases

Frame interpolation supports:
- **Increasing frame rate in short clips** - Convert low-FPS videos to higher frame rates
- **Smoothing motion in generated or edited video** - Reduce stuttering and stepping artifacts
- **Preparing sequences for downstream video models** - Standardize frame rate for consistent processing
- **Fixing low-FPS generations** - Many video generation workflows default to 16fps, which can introduce noticeable stutter

## Why frame interpolation matters

Many image and video generation workflows still default to 16fps, which can introduce noticeable stutter, stepping, and uneven motion—especially in camera moves and character animation. 

Frame interpolation is an effective way to smooth these artifacts without regenerating the source frames, making motion feel more natural while preserving the original composition and timing.

Rather than always treating interpolation as a final post-process, it can also be used as a preprocessing step—allowing you to standardize frame rate early and feed cleaner temporal data into larger animation and video pipelines.
