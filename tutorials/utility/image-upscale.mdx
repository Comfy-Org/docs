## Key concepts

### Upscaling vs. enhancement

- **Upscaling** increases resolution while reconstructing detail.
- **Enhancement** improves perceived quality (denoise, sharpen, restore, color, faces, etc.).

The best practice in AI pipelines usually combines both steps.

### Creative vs. conservative upscale

| | Conservative | Creative |
|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Preserve the original | Reimagine and enhance |
| **Strengths** | High accuracy, consistency, production-safe | Rich details, sharper, more visually striking |
| **Limits** | Can appear flat, limited improvement on poor input | Possible hallucinations or structural drift |
| **Models** | Magnific Precise, SeedVR2, FlashVSR, Topaz Fast, HitPaw | Wan 2.2, Magnific Creative, Topaz Astra, HitPaw Creative |

## Use cases

### Portrait and skin enhancement

Achieving realistic skin details while maintaining character consistency is key for portrait upscaling. The best models add texture, pores, and natural skin imperfections.

**Recommended**: Magnific Image Skin Enhancer

### Product photography

Maintaining faithful representation of materials, product label edges, and small text requires conservative upscaling models.

**Recommended**: HitPaw, Magnific Precise, WaveSpeed SeedVR2, Nano Banana Pro

### Landscape and environments

The model choice depends on your needs:
- **Creative models**: Make environmental shots pop with details and mood.
- **Conservative models**: Keep buildings and structures consistent.

Creative models may reimagine artifacts while conservative models will not.

### Stylized art and illustration

For distinct or unique styles, conservative models work best to avoid adding unwanted details. For images with room for detail, creative models can improve the style.

**Tip**: Adjust the `creativity` parameters in Magnific Creative and Topaz Image Enhance to find the right balance.

### AI-generated images

Creative upscaling cannot reliably fix common AI issues like extra fingers, artifacts, or incorrect anatomy. Best practice is to resolve these issues before upscaling using image-edit models or traditional tools.

## Available models

### Local models (ESRGAN)

For basic local upscaling using ESRGAN models, see the [basic upscale tutorial](/tutorials/basic/upscale).

| Model | Best for |
|---|---|
| RealESRGAN | General-purpose upscaling |
| BSRGAN | Text and sharp edges |
| SwinIR | Natural textures, landscapes |

### Partner nodes

Partner nodes provide access to advanced upscaling models via API.

| Model | Type | Max resolution | Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Topaz Image Enhance (Bloom) | Creative | 8K | Subject detection, face enhancement, color preservation |
| Magnific Precise | Conservative | - | High accuracy, production-safe |
| Magnific Creative | Creative | - | Detail reimagination, skin enhancement |
| Magnific Skin Enhancer | Creative | - | Portrait-specific, adds realistic skin texture |
| Nano Banana Pro | Conservative | - | Fast, good for product photography |
| WaveSpeed SeedVR2 | Conservative | - | High fidelity |
| HitPaw | Both | - | Conservative and creative modes |

## Benchmark: 1K to 4K upscale time

| Model | Time |
|---|---|
| Nano Banana Pro | ~80s |
| Topaz Image Enhance | ~100s |

## Tips

- For SeedVR2, downscale the image to 0.35 megapixels with the `ImageScaleToTotalPixels` node before upscaling for better results.
- Chain multiple upscale nodes (e.g., 2x → 4x) for ultra-high magnification.
- Connect upscale nodes after generation for "generate + enhance" pipelines.
- Test multiple models on your specific image type to find the best fit.
