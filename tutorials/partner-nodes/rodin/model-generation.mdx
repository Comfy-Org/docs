Hyper3D Rodin (hyper3d.ai) is a platform focused on rapidly generating high-quality, production-ready 3D models and materials through artificial intelligence.
ComfyUI has now natively integrated the corresponding Rodin model generation API, allowing you to conveniently use the related nodes in ComfyUI for model generation.

Currently, ComfyUI's Partner nodes support the following Rodin model generation capabilities:
- Single-view model generation
- Multi-view model generation
- Model generation with different levels of detail

## Single-view Model Generation Workflow

### 1. Workflow File Download

Download the file below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow.

style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#0078D6', color: '#ffffff', padding: '10px 20px', borderRadius: '8px', borderColor: "transparent", textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: 'bold'}}

### 2. Complete the Workflow Execution Step by Step

You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic text-to-image workflow execution:  
1. In the `Load Image` node, load the provided input image
2. (Optional) In `Rodin 3D Generate - Regular Generate` adjust the corresponding parameters
   - polygon_count: You can set different polygon counts, the higher the value, the smoother and more detailed the model
3. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute model generation. After the workflow completes, the corresponding model will be automatically saved to the `ComfyUI/output/Rodin` directory
4. In the `Preview 3D` node, click to expand the menu
5. Select `Export` to directly export the corresponding model

## Multi-view Model Generation Workflow

The corresponding `Rodin 3D Generate - Regular Generate` allows up to 5 image inputs

### 1. Workflow File Download

You can modify the single-view workflow to a multi-view workflow, or directly download the workflow file below

Download the file below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow.

## Other Related Nodes

Currently, Rodin provides different types of model generation nodes in ComfyUI, since the corresponding input conditions are the same as the workflow introduced in this article, you can enable them as needed. In addition, we have provided corresponding nodes in the corresponding templates, you can also modify the corresponding node mode as needed to enable them
