OpenAI is a company focused on generative AI, providing powerful conversational capabilities. Currently, ComfyUI has integrated the OpenAI API, allowing you to directly use the related nodes in ComfyUI to complete conversational functions.

In this guide, we will walk you through completing the corresponding conversational functionality.

## OpenAI Chat Workflow

### 1. Workflow File Download

Please download the Json file below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow.

### 2. Complete the Workflow Execution Step by Step

<Note>
In the corresponding template, we have built a role setting for analyzing prompt generation.
</Note>

You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic text-to-image workflow execution:  
1. In the `Load Image` node, load the image you need AI to interpret
2. (Optional) If needed, you can modify the settings in `OpenAI Chat Advanced Options` to have AI execute specific tasks
3. In the `OpenAI Chat` node, you can modify `Prompt` to set the conversation prompt, or modify `model` to select different models
4. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute the conversation.
5. After waiting for the API to return results, you can view the corresponding AI returned content in the `Preview Any` node.

### 3. Additional Notes

- Currently, the file input node `OpenAI Chat Input Files` requires files to be uploaded to the `ComfyUI/input/` directory first. This node is being improved, and we will modify the template after updates
- The workflow provides an example using `Batch Images` for input. If you have multiple images that need AI interpretation, you can refer to the step diagram and use right-click to set the corresponding node mode to `Always` to enable it
