Recraft V4 is a new image generation model built for professional design work. It was developed in collaboration with designers and optimized for composition, lighting, color relationships, and material realism.

## What's new in V4

- **Raster + vector in one model** — photorealistic images, stylized illustrations, and production-ready SVGs from the same model
- **Better detail** — cleaner textures, more accurate lighting, tighter geometry. Holds up in complex scenes
- **Faces and anatomy that work** — reliable proportions and expressions, even with multiple subjects or action poses
- **Text rendering** — legible text for signage, packaging, infographics. Handles short and mid-length phrases well
- **SVG output** — editable vectors with clean lines and proper color segmentation. Production-quality vector output
- **Prompt accuracy** — follows detailed creative direction closely, including spatial relationships, materials, and reflections
- **V4 Pro** — same model, higher resolution. Outputs at 2048×2048 for print and large-format work

## Recraft V4 text to vector workflow

Recraft V4 can generate production-ready SVG vector outputs directly. This is useful for logos, icons, brand assets, or anything that needs to scale. SVG outputs are compatible with Illustrator, Figma, and Sketch.
