Google Gemini is a powerful AI model developed by Google, supporting conversational and text generation functions. Currently, ComfyUI has integrated the Google Gemini API, allowing you to directly use the related nodes in ComfyUI to complete conversational functions.

In this guide, we will walk you through completing the corresponding conversational functionality.

## Google Gemini Chat Workflow

### 1. Workflow File Download

Please download the Json file below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow.

</a>

### 2. Complete the Workflow Execution Step by Step

<Note>
In the corresponding template, we have built a prompt for analyzing and generating role prompts, used to interpret your images into corresponding drawing prompts
</Note>

You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic text-to-image workflow execution:  
1. In the `Load Image` node, load the image you need AI to interpret
2. (Optional) If needed, you can modify the prompt in `Google Gemini` to have AI execute specific tasks
3. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute the conversation.
4. After waiting for the API to return results, you can view the corresponding AI returned content in the `Preview Any` node.

### 3. Additional Notes

- Currently, the file input node `Gemini Input Files` requires files to be uploaded to the `ComfyUI/input/` directory first. This node is being improved, and we will modify the template after updates
- The workflow provides an example using `Batch Images` for input. If you have multiple images that need AI interpretation, you can refer to the step diagram and use right-click to set the corresponding node mode to `Always` to enable it
