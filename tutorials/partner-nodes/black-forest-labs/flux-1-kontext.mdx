FLUX.1 Kontext is a professional image-to-image editing model developed by Black Forest Labs, focusing on intelligent understanding of image context and precise editing.
It can perform various editing tasks without complex descriptions, including object modification, style transfer, background replacement, character consistency editing, and text editing.
The core advantage of Kontext lies in its excellent context understanding ability and character consistency maintenance, ensuring that key elements such as character features and composition layout remain stable even after multiple iterations of editing.

Currently, ComfyUI has supported two models of Flux.1 Kontext:

* **Kontext Pro** is ideal for editing, composing, and remixing.
* **Kontext Max** pushes the limits on typography, prompt precision, and speed.

In this guide, we will briefly introduce how to use the Flux.1 Kontext Partner nodes to perform image editing through corresponding workflows.

## Flux.1 Kontext Multiple Image Input Workflow

We have recently updated to support multiple image input workflows. Using the new `Image Stitch` node, you can stitch multiple images into a single image and edit it using Flux.1 Kontext.

### 1. Workflow File Download

The `metadata` of the images below contains the workflow information. Please download and drag them into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow.

Download the following images for input or use your own images:

### 2. Complete the Workflow Step by Step

![ComfyUI Flux.1 Kontext Pro Image API Node Workflow Steps](/images/tutorial/api_nodes/bfl/flux_1_kontext_multiple_image_input_guide.jpg)

You can follow the numbered steps in the image to complete the workflow:

1. Upload the provided images in the `Load image` node
2. Modify the necessary parameters in `Flux.1 Kontext Pro Image`:
    - `prompt` Enter the prompt for the image you want to edit
    - `aspect_ratio` Set the aspect ratio of the original image, which must be between 1:4 and 4:1
    - `prompt_upsampling` Set whether to use prompt upsampling. If enabled, it will automatically modify the prompt to get richer results, but the results are not reproducible
3. Click the `Run` button or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute the image editing
4. After waiting for the API to return results, you can view the edited image in the `Save Image` node, and the corresponding image will also be saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory

<Tip>
   The subsequent two workflows only differ in the Partner nodes used. In fact, you only need to modify based on the multiple image input workflow, with no significant differences
