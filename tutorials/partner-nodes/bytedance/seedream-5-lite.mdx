Seedream 5.0 lite is the latest image generation model from BytePlus. It is the first in the Seedream family to bring in web-connected retrieval, which means the model can draw on live online information when generating images.

## What's new in Seedream 5.0 lite

- **Web-connected retrieval** — The model pulls from live web data during generation, allowing creations to be tied to real-world trends, current events, and up-to-date knowledge
- **Smarter instruction following** — Handles complex, multi-step instructional prompts far more reliably. Multi-image inputs, local editing instructions, and batch style requests all land closer to the intended output
- **Stronger consistency** — Character identity, product appearance, style, and lighting all hold up much better across a set of generated images
- **Deeper world knowledge** — Expanded knowledge base makes the model useful for technical illustration, educational diagrams, and knowledge-heavy creative work
