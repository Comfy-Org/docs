Meshy is a leading AI-powered 3D generation platform that enables users to create high-quality 3D models from text prompts, images, or multi-view inputs. ComfyUI has now natively integrated the Meshy API, allowing you to conveniently use the related nodes for 3D model generation.

## About Meshy 6

Meshy 6 is the latest generation of Meshy's 3D model generation technology, featuring significant improvements in geometry quality, texture fidelity, and workflow efficiency.

**Model highlights:**
- **Smarter geometry**: Improved mesh topology with cleaner edges and more coherent structures
- **Higher texture fidelity**: Enhanced texture generation with better detail preservation and color accuracy
- **Faster workflows**: Optimized generation pipeline for quicker turnaround times
- **Multiple input modes**: Supports text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and multi-view to 3D generation
- **PBR support**: Generate physically-based rendering maps including metallic, roughness, and normal maps
