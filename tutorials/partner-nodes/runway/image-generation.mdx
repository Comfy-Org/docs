Runway is a company focused on generative AI, providing powerful image generation capabilities. Its models support features such as style transfer, image extension, and detail control. Currently, ComfyUI has integrated the Runway API, allowing you to directly use the related nodes in ComfyUI for image generation.

In this guide, we will walk you through the following workflows:
- Text-to-image
- Reference-to-image

You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic text-to-image workflow execution:  
1. In the `Runway Text to Image` node, input your prompt in the `prompt` field
2. (Optional) Adjust the `ratio` setting to set different output aspect ratios
3. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute image generation.
4. After waiting for the API to return results, you can view the generated image in the `Save Image` node (right-click to save). The corresponding image will also be saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory.

## Runway Image Reference-to-Image Workflow

### 1. Workflow and Input Image Download

You can refer to the numbers in the image to complete the basic reference-to-image workflow execution:  

1. In the `Load Image` node, load the provided input image
2. In the `Runway Text to Image` node, input your prompt in the `prompt` field and adjust dimensions
3. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute image generation.
4. After waiting for the API to return results, you can view the generated image in the `Save Image` node (right-click to save). The corresponding image will also be saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory.
