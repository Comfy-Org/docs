Hunyuan 3D 3.0 is Tencent's state-of-the-art 3D generation model that enables minutes-level 3D content creation. It can generate production-ready 3D assets from text prompts, images, or sketches with far lower barriers to entry than traditional 3D modeling pipelines.

ComfyUI has now natively integrated the corresponding Hunyuan 3D API, allowing you to conveniently use the related nodes in ComfyUI for model generation.

Currently, ComfyUI's Partner nodes support the following Hunyuan 3D model generation capabilities:
- Text-to-3D generation
- Image-to-3D generation
- Multi-view-to-3D generation

## Use cases

- **Game development ideation**: Fast generation of characters, props, and environments with optimized topology for rigging and real-time rendering
- **Product & e-commerce**: Turn product photos into interactive 3D models for online display
- **Industrial design**: Sketch-to-3D prototyping and 3D-print-ready part decomposition
- **VFX & animation**: High-resolution assets with professional UVs and PBR materials

## Getting started

### 1. Access workflow templates

1. Open the Template Library in the sidebar
2. Navigate to **3D** → **Hunyuan 3D**
3. Select a workflow template for Hunyuan 3D

### 2. Run the workflow

1. Input your text prompt, images, or sketches depending on the workflow type
2. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute model generation
3. After the workflow completes, preview and export your 3D model

## Text-to-3D workflow

Enter a text description to generate a 3D model in one click. The model accurately follows style, shape, and material details for consistent results.

**Example prompt**: "Mechanical dolphin with gears, steampunk"
