Kling 3.0 is one of the most advanced multi-modal generation systems, now available in ComfyUI via Partner Nodes. This release includes **Kling Video 3.0**, **Kling Video 3.0 Omni**, **Kling Image 3.0**, and **Kling Image 3.0 Omni**, bringing video, image, audio-visual, and narrative generation capabilities directly into your node-based workflows.

## Product highlights

### Multi-shot with duration control

The new **Multi-Shot** capability understands scene coverage directly from your prompt and automatically plans camera angles, shot composition, dialogue shot-reverse-shot, and cross-cutting structures.

Instead of manual editing and cutting, you can tell the model **how many shots** you want in one generation and explicitly assign **length to each shot**.

**Example prompt:**
```
Shot 1: Fast-paced tracking shot of the motorcycle in a wheelie and the horse galloping, subtle dust kicking up
Shot 2: Low-angle shot of the horse's hooves and the bike wheel
Shot 3: Over-the-shoulder shot of the subject riding the motorcycle
Shot 4: Extreme slow motion of the horse mid jump
```

### Image-to-video with locked subject consistency

Kling 3.0 dramatically improves **reference-driven generation**:

- Supports **multi-image and video references** as scene elements
- Builds stable identities for **characters, products, and environments**
- Maintains consistency across **camera motion and scene evolution**

This enables **production-grade continuity** for storytelling, branding, and character-based workflows inside ComfyUI.

**Example prompt with references:**
```
Shot 1: Dolly in on the silhouetted subject from @image
Shot 2: Arc shot from behind @character to a front view, he is tense, visible chest raises as he takes deep breaths, slow zoom towards his face
Shot 3: @character holds the handheld @device, it is emitting a subtle glow, and he presses the button
Shot 4: Shot of the menacing monolith tower from @image, the monolith explodes, and blasts fire into the sky.
```

### Native audio with character awareness

Audio generation is now deeply integrated with scene understanding:

- Precise control over **which character is speaking** in multi-character scenes
- Support for **Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish**
- Authentic **dialects, accents, and multilingual code-switching**
- Natural **lip sync and facial expression alignment**

**Example prompt:**
```
The woman (softly in a concerned tone), "Are you sure that's legal?" The man responds, he has a sly smile, (in a cool and confident deep southern voice), "These undisclosed paid ads will never see the light of day." He closes the trunk, pitch black.
```

### Native-level text rendering in video

Kling 3.0 can now reliably produce **clear, structured on-screen text**:

- Preserves original **signage and captions**
- Generates new **layout-aware typography**
- Improves realism for **ads, UI scenes, and branded content**

This is a major step toward **usable commercial video generation**.

## Tips for better results

- **Use clear shot descriptions**: When using multi-shot generation, describe each shot with specific camera movements and actions
- **Reference images with @**: Use `@image`, `@character`, or `@device` syntax to reference uploaded images in your prompts
- **Specify audio details**: For dialogue, include tone, accent, and emotional cues in parentheses
- **Plan shot durations**: Explicitly assign duration to each shot for better pacing control
- **Match reference framing**: Ensure your reference images have appropriate framing for the intended camera movements
