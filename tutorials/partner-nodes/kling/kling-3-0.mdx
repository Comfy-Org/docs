## Product highlights

### Multi-shot with duration control

The new **Multi-Shot** capability understands scene coverage directly from your prompt and automatically plans camera angles, shot composition, dialogue shot-reverse-shot, and cross-cutting structures.

Instead of manual editing and cutting, you can tell the model **how many shots** you want in one generation and explicitly assign **length to each shot**.

**Example prompt:**
```
Shot 1: Fast-paced tracking shot of the motorcycle in a wheelie and the horse galloping, subtle dust kicking up
Shot 2: Low-angle shot of the horse's hooves and the bike wheel
Shot 3: Over-the-shoulder shot of the subject riding the motorcycle
Shot 4: Extreme slow motion of the horse mid jump
```

### Image-to-video with locked subject consistency

Kling 3.0 dramatically improves **reference-driven generation**:

- Supports **multi-image and video references** as scene elements
- Builds stable identities for **characters, products, and environments**
- Maintains consistency across **camera motion and scene evolution**

This enables **production-grade continuity** for storytelling, branding, and character-based workflows inside ComfyUI.

**Example prompt with references:**
```
Shot 1: Dolly in on the silhouetted subject from @image
Shot 2: Arc shot from behind @character to a front view, he is tense, visible chest raises as he takes deep breaths, slow zoom towards his face
Shot 3: @character holds the handheld @device, it is emitting a subtle glow, and he presses the button
Shot 4: Shot of the menacing monolith tower from @image, the monolith explodes, and blasts fire into the sky.
```

### Native audio with character awareness

Audio generation is now deeply integrated with scene understanding:

- Precise control over **which character is speaking** in multi-character scenes
- Support for **Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish**
- Authentic **dialects, accents, and multilingual code-switching**
- Natural **lip sync and facial expression alignment**

**Example prompt:**
```
The woman (softly in a concerned tone), "Are you sure that's legal?" The man responds, he has a sly smile, (in a cool and confident deep southern voice), "These undisclosed paid ads will never see the light of day." He closes the trunk, pitch black.
```

### Native-level text rendering in video

Kling 3.0 can now reliably produce **clear, structured on-screen text**:

- Preserves original **signage and captions**
- Generates new **layout-aware typography**
- Improves realism for **ads, UI scenes, and branded content**

This is a major step toward **usable commercial video generation**.

**Example prompt:**
```
Beneath the surface of a crystal-clear stream, with a haunting solo cello and ambient water sounds in the background, golden afternoon light refracts through the rippling water onto smooth river stones. Slow zoom into the ring, displaying the text "Comfy" in cursive in the ring's interior. Voiceover (deep, reverent male voice, aged British accent, slow pace): One node to rule them all.
```

## Tips for better results

- **Use clear shot descriptions**: When using multi-shot generation, describe each shot with specific camera movements and actions
- **Reference images with @**: Use `@image`, `@character`, or `@device` syntax to reference uploaded images in your prompts
- **Specify audio details**: For dialogue, include tone, accent, and emotional cues in parentheses
- **Plan shot durations**: Explicitly assign duration to each shot for better pacing control
- **Match reference framing**: Ensure your reference images have appropriate framing for the intended camera movements
