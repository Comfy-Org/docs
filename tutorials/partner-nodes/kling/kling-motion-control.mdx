Kling 2.6 Motion Control is a specialized multimodal model developed by Kuaishou that enables precise motion transfer from reference videos to character images. By combining a **Reference Image** (your character) and a **Motion Reference Video** (the action), the AI applies the movement, expression, and pacing of the video to your static character while maintaining their identity.

Unlike standard image-to-video generation that guesses motion from text prompts, Motion Control uses a reference video as the movement blueprint. The model acts as a digital puppeteer, extracting choreography from your reference video and applying it to your character with cinema-grade fidelity.

## Product highlights

- **Complex motion handling**: Execute complicated sequences like dance routines, martial arts, or athletic movements without losing character coherence. The model understands weight transfer and momentum for realistic physical impact.
- **Precision hand and finger performance**: Hands have traditionally been a weak point for AI video. This feature specifically improves finger articulation and hand movements by mimicking real footage, making it ideal for presentations and demonstrations.
- **Scene and environment flexibility**: Use text prompts to change the environment while the character continues their referenced motion. You're not limited to the reference video's background.
- **Advanced camera and perspective modes**: Granular control over how the camera interprets your reference with distinct orientation modes.
- **30-second one-shot support**: Generate continuous actions up to 30 seconds in a single generation, enabling uninterrupted character motion for narrative scenes.

## Character orientation modes

The `character_orientation` parameter determines how the model interprets spatial information and constrains output duration:

| Mode | Description | Max Duration |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `video` | Output character orientation matches the reference video. Best for complex full-body performances like dance sequences and elaborate choreography. | 30 seconds |
| `image` | Output character orientation matches the reference image. Best for portrait animations with camera movement like pans, tilts, and tracking shots. | 10 seconds |

## Model tiers

| Tier | Resolution | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Standard** | 720p | Simple animations, social media content, memes, and quick tests. Faster and more credit-efficient. |
| **Pro** | 1080p | Complex choreography, intricate hand movements, professional marketing assets, and broadcast-quality content. |

## Tips for better results

- **Match aspect ratios**: Ensure your character image and reference video have similar aspect ratios to prevent awkward stretching or cropping
- **Clean backgrounds**: Use reference videos with simple or static backgrounds for best motion extraction
- **Clear character angles**: If your reference video shows rotation, use 3D-style characters or realistic photos that handle rotation better
- **Visible limbs**: If the motion requires hand waving but the character has hands in pockets, the AI may produce artifacts
