Kling 2.6 Motion Control is a specialized multimodal model that enables precise motion transfer from reference videos to character images. By combining a **Reference Image** (your character) and a **Motion Reference Video** (the action), the AI applies the movement, expression, and pacing of the video to your static character while maintaining their identity.

## Product highlights

- **Complex motion handling**: Execute complicated sequences like dance routines or martial arts without losing character coherence
- **Precision hand and finger performance**: Improved finger articulation and hand movements by mimicking real footage
- **Scene and environment flexibility**: Use text prompts to change the environment while the character continues their referenced motion
- **Advanced camera and perspective modes**: Granular control over how the camera interprets your reference with distinct orientation modes

## Tips for better results

- **Match aspect ratios**: Ensure your character image and reference video have similar aspect ratios to prevent awkward stretching or cropping
- **Clean backgrounds**: Use reference videos with simple or static backgrounds for best motion extraction
- **Clear character angles**: If your reference video shows rotation, use 3D-style characters or realistic photos that handle rotation better
- **Visible limbs**: If the motion requires hand waving but the character has hands in pockets, the AI may produce artifacts
