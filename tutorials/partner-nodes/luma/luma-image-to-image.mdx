The [Luma Image to Image](/built-in-nodes/partner-node/image/luma/luma-image-to-image) node allows you to modify existing images based on text prompts using Luma AI technology, while preserving certain features and structures from the original image.

In this guide, we'll show you how to set up an image-to-image workflow using this node.

## Luma Image to Image API Node Workflow

<Tip>
This feature works well for changing objects and shapes. However, it may not be ideal for color changes. We recommend using lower weight values, around 0.0 to 0.1.
</Tip>

### 1. Download Workflow File

Download and drag the following image into ComfyUI to load the workflow (workflow information is included in the image metadata):

### 2. Complete the Workflow Steps

![Luma Image to Image Workflow Steps](/images/tutorial/api_nodes/luma/luma_i2i_step_guide.jpg)

Follow these numbered steps:
1. Click **Upload** on the `Load Image` node to upload your input image
2. (Optional) Modify the workflow prompts
3. (Optional) Adjust `image_weight` to change input image influence (lower values stay closer to original)
4. Click `Run` or use shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to generate the image
5. After API returns results, view the generated image in the `Save Image` node. Images are saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory

### 3. Results with Different `image_weight` Values
