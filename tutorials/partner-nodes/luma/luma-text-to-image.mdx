The [Luma Text to Image](/built-in-nodes/partner-node/image/luma/luma-text-to-image) node allows you to generate high-quality images from text prompts using Luma AI's advanced technology, capable of creating photorealistic content and artistic style images.

In this guide, we'll show you how to set up workflows using this node for text-to-image generation.

## Luma Text to Image API Node Workflow

When the `Luma Text to Image` node is used without any image inputs, it functions as a text-to-image workflow. In this guide, we've created examples using `style_image` and `image_luma_ref` to showcase Luma AI's excellent image processing capabilities.

### 1. Download Workflow Files

The workflow information is included in the metadata of the image below. Download and drag it into ComfyUI to load the workflow.

Please download these images for input:

### 2. Follow Steps to Run the Workflow

![Luma Text to Image Workflow Steps](/images/tutorial/api_nodes/luma/luma_t2i_step_guide.jpg)

Follow the numbered steps in the image to complete the basic workflow:
1. Upload the reference image in the `Load image` node
2. Upload the style reference image in the `Load image (renamed to styleref)` node
3. (Optional) Modify the prompts in the `Luma Text to Image` node
4. (Optional) Adjust the `style_image_weight` to control the style reference image's influence
5. Click the `Run` button or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to generate the image
6. After the API returns results, view the generated image in the `Save Image` node. Images are saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory

### 3. Additional Notes

- The [node](/built-in-nodes/partner-node/image/luma/luma-text-to-image) allows up to 4 reference images and character references simultaneously.
- To enable multiple image inputs, right-click on the purple "Bypassed" nodes and set their `mode` to `always`
