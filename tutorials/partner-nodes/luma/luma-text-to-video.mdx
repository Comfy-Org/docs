## Text to Video Workflow with Luma API Node

The Luma Text to Video node requires text prompts to describe the video content. In this guide, we've created examples using `prompt` and `luma_concepts` to showcase Luma AI's excellent video generation capabilities.

### 1. Download the Workflow

The workflow information is included in the metadata of the video below. Download and drag it into ComfyUI to load the workflow.

### 2. Follow the Steps

![Luma Text to Video Workflow Steps](/images/tutorial/api_nodes/luma/luma_t2v_step_guide.jpg)

Follow these basic steps to run the workflow:
1. Write your prompt in the `Luma Text to Video` node to describe the video content you want
2. Click the `Run` button or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to generate the video
3. After the API returns results, you can view the generated video in the `Save Video` node. The video will also be saved to the `ComfyUI/output/` directory

> (Optional) Modify the `Luma Concepts` node to control camera movements and add professional cinematography

### 3. Additional Notes

- **Writing Prompts**: Describe scenes, subjects, actions, and mood in detail for best results
- **Luma Concepts**: Mainly used for camera control to create professional video shots
- **Seed Parameter**: Only determines if the node should rerun, doesn't affect generation results
- **Model Selection**: Different video models have different features, adjustable via the model parameter
- **Resolution and Duration**: Adjust output video resolution and length using these parameters
- **Ray 1.6 Model Note**: Duration and resolution parameters don't work when using the Ray 1.6 model
