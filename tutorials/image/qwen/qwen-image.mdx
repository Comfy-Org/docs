**Qwen-Image** is the first image generation foundation model released by Alibaba's Qwen team. It's a 20B parameter MMDiT (Multimodal Diffusion Transformer) model open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license. The model has made significant advances in **complex text rendering** and **precise image editing**, achieving high-fidelity output for multiple languages including English and Chinese.

**Model Highlights**:
- **Excellent Multilingual Text Rendering**: Supports high-precision text generation in multiple languages including English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, maintaining font details and layout consistency
- **Diverse Artistic Styles**: From photorealistic scenes to impressionist paintings, from anime aesthetics to minimalist design, fluidly adapting to various creative prompts

### 3. Workflow Instructions

![Step Guide](/images/tutorial/image/qwen/image_qwen_image-guide.jpg)

1. Make sure the `Load Diffusion Model` node has loaded `qwen_image_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors`
2. Make sure the `Load CLIP` node has loaded `qwen_2.5_vl_7b_fp8_scaled.safetensors`
3. Make sure the `Load VAE` node has loaded `qwen_image_vae.safetensors`
4. Make sure the `EmptySD3LatentImage` node is set with the correct image dimensions
5. Set your prompt in the `CLIP Text Encoder` node; currently, it supports at least English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Italian, etc.
6. If you want to enable the 8-step acceleration LoRA by lightx2v, select the node and use `Ctrl + B` to enable it, and modify the Ksampler settings as described in step 8
7. Click the `Queue` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow
8. For different model versions and workflows, adjust the KSampler parameters accordingly

<Note>
 The distilled model and the 8-step acceleration LoRA by lightx2v do not seem to be compatible for simultaneous use. You can experiment with different combinations to verify if they can be used together.
</Note>

2. Upload input image
3. This subgraph uses the Lotus Depth model. You can find it in the templates or edit the subgraph to learn more, make sure all the models are loaded correctly
4. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow

## Qwen Image ControlNet DiffSynth-ControlNets Model Patches Workflow

This model is actually not a ControlNet, but a Model patch that supports three different control modes: canny, depth, and inpaint.

### 2. Model Links

Other models are the same as the Qwen-Image basic workflow. You only need to download the models below and save them to the `ComfyUI/models/model_patches` folder

- [qwen_image_canny_diffsynth_controlnet.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image-DiffSynth-ControlNets/resolve/main/split_files/model_patches/qwen_image_canny_diffsynth_controlnet.safetensors)

### 3. Workflow Usage Instructions

Currently, diffsynth has three patch models: Canny, Depth, and Inpaint.

If you're using ControlNet-related workflows for the first time, you need to understand that control images need to be preprocessed into supported image formats before they can be used and recognized by the model.

![Input Type Diagram](/images/tutorial/image/qwen/controlnet_input_types.jpg)

- Canny: Processed canny edge, line art contours
- Depth: Preprocessed depth map showing spatial relationships
- Inpaint: Requires using Mask to mark areas that need to be repainted

Since this patch model is divided into three different models, you need to select the correct preprocessing type when inputting to ensure proper image preprocessing.

**Canny Model ControlNet Usage Instructions**

![Canny Workflow](/images/tutorial/image/qwen/image_qwen_image_controlnet_patch-canny.jpg)
1. Ensure that `qwen_image_canny_diffsynth_controlnet.safetensors` is loaded
2. Upload input image for subsequent processing
3. The Canny node is a native preprocessing node that will preprocess the input image according to your set parameters to control generation
4. If needed, you can modify the `strength` in the `QwenImageDiffsynthControlnet` node to control the intensity of line art control
5. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow

> For using qwen_image_depth_diffsynth_controlnet.safetensors, you need to preprocess the image into a depth map and replace the `image processing` part. For this usage, please refer to the InstantX processing method in this document. Other parts are similar to using the Canny model.

**Inpaint Model ControlNet Usage Instructions**
![Inpaint Workflow](/images/tutorial/image/qwen/image_qwen_image_controlnet_patch-inpaint.jpg)

For the Inpaint model, it requires using the [Mask Editor](/interface/maskeditor) to draw a mask and use it as input control condition.

1. Ensure that `ModelPatchLoader` loads the `qwen_image_inpaint_diffsynth_controlnet.safetensors` model
2. Upload image and use the [Mask Editor](/interface/maskeditor) to draw a mask. You need to connect the `mask` output of the corresponding `Load Image` node to the `mask` input of `QwenImageDiffsynthControlnet` to ensure the corresponding mask is loaded
3. Use the `Ctrl-B` shortcut to set the original Canny in the workflow to bypass mode, making the corresponding Canny node processing ineffective
4. In `CLIP Text Encoder`, input what you want to change the masked area to
5. If needed, you can modify the `strength` in the `QwenImageDiffsynthControlnet` node to control the corresponding control intensity
6. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow

## Qwen Image Union ControlNet LoRA Workflow

Original model address: [DiffSynth-Studio/Qwen-Image-In-Context-Control-Union](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/DiffSynth-Studio/Qwen-Image-In-Context-Control-Union/)

![workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/image/qwen/qwen-image-union-control-lora/input.png)

### 2. Model Links

Download the model below. Since this is a LoRA model, it needs to be saved to the `ComfyUI/models/loras/` folder
-  [qwen_image_union_diffsynth_lora.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image-DiffSynth-ControlNets/blob/main/split_files/loras/qwen_image_union_diffsynth_lora.safetensors): Image structure control LoRA supporting canny, depth, pose, lineart, softedge, normal, openpose

### 3. Workflow Instructions

This model is a unified control LoRA that supports canny, depth, pose, lineart, softedge, normal, openpose controls. Since many image preprocessing native nodes are not fully supported, you should use something like [comfyui_controlnet_aux](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux) to complete other image preprocessing.

![Union Control LoRA](/images/tutorial/image/qwen/image_qwen_image_union_control_lora.jpg)

1. Ensure that `LoraLoaderModelOnly` correctly loads the `qwen_image_union_diffsynth_lora.safetensors` model
2. Upload input image
3. If needed, you can adjust the `Canny` node parameters. Since different input images require different parameter settings to get better image preprocessing results, you can try adjusting the corresponding parameter values to get more/fewer details
4. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow

> For other types of control, you also need to replace the image processing part.
