{/* Wan FLF2V (First-Last Frame Video Generation) is an open-source video generation model developed by the Alibaba Tongyi Wanxiang team. Its open-source license is [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file).
Users only need to provide two images as the starting and ending frames, and the model automatically generates intermediate transition frames, outputting a logically coherent and naturally flowing 720p high-definition video.

**Core Technical Highlights**

1. **Precise First-Last Frame Control**: The matching rate of first and last frames reaches 98%, defining video boundaries through starting and ending scenes, intelligently filling intermediate dynamic changes to achieve scene transitions and object morphing effects.
2. **Stable and Smooth Video Generation**: Using CLIP semantic features and cross-attention mechanisms, the video jitter rate is reduced by 37% compared to similar models, ensuring natural and smooth transitions.
3. **Multi-functional Creative Capabilities**: Supports dynamic embedding of Chinese and English subtitles, generation of anime/realistic/fantasy and other styles, adapting to different creative needs.
4. **720p HD Output**: Directly generates 1280×720 resolution videos without post-processing, suitable for social media and commercial applications.
5. **Open-source Ecosystem Support**: Model weights, code, and training framework are fully open-sourced, supporting deployment on mainstream AI platforms.

**Technical Principles and Architecture**

1. **DiT Architecture**: Based on diffusion models and Diffusion Transformer architecture, combined with Full Attention mechanism to optimize spatiotemporal dependency modeling, ensuring video coherence.
2. **3D Causal Variational Encoder**: Wan-VAE technology compresses HD frames to 1/128 size while retaining subtle dynamic details, significantly reducing memory requirements.
3. **Three-stage Training Strategy**: Starting from 480P resolution pre-training, gradually upgrading to 720P, balancing generation quality and computational efficiency through phased optimization.

## Wan2.1 FLF2V 720P ComfyUI Native Workflow Example */}

### 1. Download Workflow Files and Related Input Files

<Note>
We provide only the fp16 version of the model, which may cause difficulties in normal operation under lower VRAM.
</Note>

Please download the WebP file below, and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow. The workflow has embedded the corresponding model download file information.

### 3. Complete Workflow Execution Step by Step

![Wan2.1 FLF2V 720P Native Workflow Steps](/images/tutorial/video/wan/wan2.1_flf2v_14B_720P_step_guide.jpg)

1. Ensure the `Load Diffusion Model` node has loaded `wan2.1_flf2v_720p_14B_fp16.safetensors`
2. Ensure the `Load CLIP` node has loaded `umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors`
3. Ensure the `Load VAE` node has loaded `wan_2.1_vae.safetensors`
4. Ensure the `Load CLIP Vision` node has loaded `clip_vision_h.safetensors`
5. Upload the starting frame to the `Start_image` node
6. Upload the ending frame to the `End_image` node
7. (Optional) Modify the positive and negative prompts, both Chinese and English are supported
8. (Optional) Modify the video size in `WanFirstLastFrameToVideo`, it is recommended to use a small size for initial testing, and then set a larger size after completion to reduce waiting time
9. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute video generation
