Wan-Alpha is a specialized text-to-video model that generates high-quality videos with alpha channel transparency. Built on the Wan2.1-14B-T2V base model, it creates videos with transparent backgrounds and semi-transparent objects, perfect for compositing workflows.

The model excels at generating transparent backgrounds, semi-transparent objects (bubbles, glass, water), glowing effects, and fine details with proper alpha channels (hair, smoke, particles).
