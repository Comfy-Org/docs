Wan2.1 Video series is a video generation model open-sourced by Alibaba in February 2025 under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file). 
It offers two versions:
- 14B (14 billion parameters) 
- 1.3B (1.3 billion parameters)
Covering multiple tasks including text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V). 
The model not only outperforms existing open-source models in performance but more importantly, its lightweight version requires only 8GB of VRAM to run, significantly lowering the barrier to entry.

## Wan2.1 ComfyUI Native Workflow Examples

<Tip>
Please update ComfyUI to the latest version before starting the examples to make sure you have native Wan Video support.
</Tip>

## Model Installation

All models mentioned in this guide can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/tree/main/split_files). Below are the common models you'll need for the examples in this guide, which you can download in advance:

Choose one version from **Text encoders** to download:
- [umt5_xxl_fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/text_encoders/umt5_xxl_fp16.safetensors?download=true)
- [umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/text_encoders/umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors?download=true)

**VAE**

**CLIP Vision**
- [clip_vision_h.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/clip_vision/clip_vision_h.safetensors?download=true)

<Note>
For diffusion models, we'll use the fp16 precision models in this guide because we've found that they perform better than the bf16 versions. If you need other precision versions, please visit [here](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/tree/main/split_files/diffusion_models) to download them.
</Note>

## Wan2.1 Text-to-Video Workflow

Before starting the workflow, please download [wan2.1_t2v_1.3B_fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/diffusion_models/wan2.1_t2v_1.3B_fp16.safetensors?download=true) and save it to the `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models/` directory.

> If you need other t2v precision versions, please visit [here](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/tree/main/split_files/diffusion_models) to download them.

### 1. Workflow File Download

Download the file below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow:

![Wan2.1 Text-to-Video Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/wan2.1/wan2.1_t2v_1.3b.webp)

### 2. Complete the Workflow Step by Step

![ComfyUI Wan2.1 Workflow Steps](/images/tutorial/video/wan/wan2.1_t2v_1.3b_flow_diagram.jpg)

1. Make sure the `Load Diffusion Model` node has loaded the `wan2.1_t2v_1.3B_fp16.safetensors` model
2. Make sure the `Load CLIP` node has loaded the `umt5_xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors` model
3. Make sure the `Load VAE` node has loaded the `wan_2.1_vae.safetensors` model
4. (Optional) You can modify the video dimensions in the `EmptyHunyuanLatentVideo` node if needed
5. (Optional) If you need to modify the prompts (positive and negative), make changes in the `CLIP Text Encoder` node at number `5`
6. Click the `Run` button or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute the video generation

## Wan2.1 Image-to-Video Workflow

**Since Wan Video separates the 480P and 720P models**, we'll need to provide examples for both resolutions in this guide. In addition to using different models, they also have slight parameter differences.
