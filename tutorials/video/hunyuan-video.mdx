Hunyuan Video series is developed and open-sourced by [Tencent](https://huggingface.co/tencent), featuring a hybrid architecture that supports both [Text-to-Video](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo) and [Image-to-Video](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V) generation with a parameter scale of 13B.

Technical features:
- **Core Architecture:** Uses a DiT (Diffusion Transformer) architecture similar to Sora, effectively fusing text, image, and motion information to improve consistency, quality, and alignment between generated video frames. A unified full-attention mechanism enables multi-view camera transitions while ensuring subject consistency.
- **3D VAE:** The custom 3D VAE compresses videos into a compact latent space, making image-to-video generation more efficient.
- **Superior Image-Video-Text Alignment:** Utilizing MLLM text encoders that excel in both image and video generation, better following text instructions, capturing details, and performing complex reasoning.

You can learn more through the official repositories: [Hunyuan Video](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo) and [Hunyuan Video-I2V](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V).

This guide will walk you through setting up both **Text-to-Video** and **Image-to-Video** workflows in ComfyUI.

<Tip>
The workflow images in this tutorial contain metadata with model download information. 

Simply drag them into ComfyUI or use the menu `Workflows` -> `Open (ctrl+o)` to load the corresponding workflow, which will prompt you to download the required models.

Alternatively, this guide provides direct model links if automatic downloads fail or you are not using the Desktop version. All models are available [here](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/HunyuanVideo_repackaged/tree/main/split_files) for download.
</Tip>

## Shared Models for All Workflows

The following models are used in both Text-to-Video and Image-to-Video workflows. Please download and save them to the specified directories:

- [clip_l.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/HunyuanVideo_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/text_encoders/clip_l.safetensors?download=true)

## Hunyuan Text-to-Video Workflow

Hunyuan Text-to-Video was open-sourced in December 2024, supporting 5-second short video generation through natural language descriptions in both Chinese and English.

### 1. Workflow

Download the image below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the workflow:
![ComfyUI Workflow - Hunyuan Text-to-Video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/main/hunyuan-video/t2v/kitchen.webp)

### 2. Manual Models Installation

Download [hunyuan_video_t2v_720p_bf16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/HunyuanVideo_repackaged/resolve/main/split_files/diffusion_models/hunyuan_video_t2v_720p_bf16.safetensors?download=true) and save it to the `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models` folder.

Ensure you have all these model files in the correct locations:

```
ComfyUI/
├── models/
│   ├── text_encoders/
│   │   ├── clip_l.safetensors                       // Shared model
│   │   └── llava_llama3_fp8_scaled.safetensors      // Shared model
│   ├── vae/
│   │   └── hunyuan_video_vae_bf16.safetensors       // Shared model
│   └── diffusion_models/
│       └── hunyuan_video_t2v_720p_bf16.safetensors  // T2V model
```

### 3. Steps to Run the Workflow

![ComfyUI Hunyuan Video T2V Workflow](/images/tutorial/advanced/hunyuanvideo/flow_diagram_t2v.jpg)

1. Ensure the `DualCLIPLoader` node has loaded these models:
   - clip_name1: clip_l.safetensors
   - clip_name2: llava_llama3_fp8_scaled.safetensors
2. Ensure the `Load Diffusion Model` node has loaded `hunyuan_video_t2v_720p_bf16.safetensors`
3. Ensure the `Load VAE` node has loaded `hunyuan_video_vae_bf16.safetensors`
4. Click the `Queue` button or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow

<Tip>
When the `length` parameter in the `EmptyHunyuanLatentVideo` node is set to 1, the model can generate a static image.
</Tip>

## Hunyuan Image-to-Video Workflow

Hunyuan Image-to-Video model was open-sourced on March 6, 2025, based on the HunyuanVideo framework. It transforms static images into smooth, high-quality videos and also provides LoRA training code to customize special video effects like hair growth, object transformation, etc.

Currently, the Hunyuan Image-to-Video model has two versions:
- v1 "concat": Better motion fluidity but less adherence to the image guidance
- v2 "replace": Updated the day after v1, with better image guidance but seemingly less dynamic compared to v1
