## Why upscaling matters

- **Industry requirements for resolutions**: 4K/8K end results are widely required across VFX & Film, Marketing, E-commerce, Gaming, and Design industries, and requirements keep moving up.
- **Reframing**: When assets ship across different aspect ratios and placements, extra resolution headroom prevents quality loss after cropping or recomposition.
- **The AI content problem**: Generative AI has dramatically increased the speed of visual creation, but most AI assets today are still generated at 480–720p, and not production-ready at the pixel level: edges, micro-texture, faces/hands, compression artifacts, etc. This creates a new pipeline: Generation → Refinement/Fix → Upscale → Delivery.
- **Cost/time efficiency**: Generate or render smaller → upscale at the end. This is a standard efficiency move in pipelines under budget/time pressure.

## What is image upscaling?

Image Upscaling is the process of converting low-resolution images to high-resolution using algorithms.
Unlike traditional interpolation methods, AI upscaling models (like ESRGAN) can intelligently reconstruct details while maintaining image quality.

For instance, the default SD1.5 model often struggles with large-size image generation. 
To achieve high-resolution results, we typically generate smaller images first and then use upscaling techniques.

This article covers one of many upscaling methods in ComfyUI. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through:
1. Downloading and installing upscaling models
2. Performing basic image upscaling
3. Combining text-to-image workflows with upscaling

## Key concepts

### Upscaling vs. enhancement

- **Upscaling** → increases resolution while reconstructing detail
- **Enhancement** → improves perceived quality (denoise, sharpen, restore, color, faces, etc.)

The best practice in AI pipelines usually combines both steps.

### Creative upscale vs. conservative upscale

Diffusion models and generative AI changed what "upscaling" means. Traditionally, super-resolution aimed to **preserve the original signal**. Today, some models can **re-imagine details that never existed**. And there are models approaching different balances between the two.

| | Conservative | Creative |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Preserve the original | Reimagine and enhance |
| **Strengths** | High accuracy, Consistency, Production-safe | Rich details, Sharper, More visually striking |
| **Limits** | Can appear flat, limited improvement on poor input | Possible hallucinations or structural drift |
| **Models** | Magnific Precise, SeedVR2, FlashVSR, Topaz Fast, HitPaw | Wan 2.2, Magnific Creative, Topaz Astra Creative, HitPaw |

## Upscaling Workflow

### Model Installation

Required ESRGAN models download:
<Steps>
<Step title="Visit OpenModelDB">
Visit [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/) to search and download upscaling models (e.g., RealESRGAN)

![openmodeldb](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale_OpenModelDB.jpg)

As shown:
1. Filter models by image type using the category selector
2. The model's magnification factor is indicated in the top-right corner (e.g., 2x in the screenshot)

We'll use the [4x-ESRGAN](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-ESRGAN) model for this tutorial. Click the `Download` button on the model detail page.

![OpenModelDB_download](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale_OpenModelDB_download.jpg)

</Step>
<Step title="Save Model Files in Directory">
Save the model file (.pth) in `ComfyUI/models/upscale_models` directory
</Step>
</Steps>


### Workflow and Assets

Download and drag the following image into ComfyUI to load the basic upscaling workflow:
![Upscale workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/image/basic/upscale_workflow.png)

<Tip>
Images containing workflow JSON in their metadata can be directly dragged into ComfyUI or loaded using the menu `Workflows` -> `Open (ctrl+o)`.
</Tip>

Use this image in smaller size as input:
![Upscale-input](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale-input.jpg)

### Complete the Workflow Step by Step

Follow the steps in the diagram below to ensure the workflow runs correctly.

![Upscale workflow](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale_simple_workflow.jpg)

1. Ensure `Load Upscale Model` loads `4x-ESRGAN.pth`
2. Upload the input image to the `Load Image` node
3. Click the `Queue` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to generate the image

The core components are the `Load Upscale Model` and `Upscale Image (Using Model)` nodes, which receive an image input and upscale it using the selected model.

## Text-to-Image Combined Workflow

After mastering basic upscaling, we can combine it with the [text-to-image](/tutorials/basic/text-to-image) workflow. For text-to-image basics, refer to the [text-to-image tutorial](/tutorials/basic/text-to-image).

Download and drag this image into ComfyUI to load the combined workflow:
![Text-to-image upscale workflow](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/esrgan_example.png)

This workflow connects the text-to-image output image directly to the upscaling nodes for final processing.

## Image upscale use cases

<Note>
**TL;DR** - Magnific Skin Enhancer for portraits. Magnific Precise, WaveSpeed SeedVR2 or Nano Banana Pro for product photography. The upscale model depends on your needs for landscapes and illustrations. Do not rely on upscaling to fix common AI artifacts. For SeedVR2, downscaling the image to 0.35 megapixels with the ImageScaleToTotalPixels node and then upscaling gets you better results.
</Note>

### Portrait / skin enhancement

When it comes to upscaling portraits of realistic subjects, achieving realistic skin details while maintaining character consistency is key. The best upscale models for fixing plastic skin need to add texture, pores and natural skin imperfections. In this domain, **Magnific Image Skin Enhancer** far outperforms the rest.

### Product photography

Maintaining a faithful representation of materials, product label edges, and small text is a must when upscaling product images. Therefore, conservative upscaling models are necessary. We recommend testing with HitPaw, Magnific Precise, WaveSpeed SeedVR2 and Nano Banana Pro.

### Landscape / environments

For this use case, the upscale model you select really depends on your needs. Have an environmental shot that you want to pop with details and set a mood? Use a creative upscale model. Have an establishing shot where a building needs to stay consistent? Use a conservative upscale model.

It's worth noting that if your input image has artifacts, creative upscale models may be able to reimagine the artifact while conservative upscale models will not.

### Stylized art / illustration

This is another use case where the correct upscale model depends on your needs. A rule of thumb is that if your input has a very distinct/unique style, the best model will be conservative. Creative models may add too many details and stray away from the desired illustrated style. However, if your input image has room for detail, a creative model works well and can even improve the style.

We recommend playing around with the 'creativity' parameters for Magnific Creative and Topaz Image Enhance to find values that meet your needs! Nano Banana Pro can also work well for more common styles and adding details (but may rely on 'seed luck').

### AI images

When it comes to upscaling images that have typical AI issues such as too many fingers, artifacts, incorrect anatomy, and morphing, the assumption is that creative upscales can fix it. Sometimes that's true, but other times not so much. Best practice is to resolve these issues prior to upscaling with image-edit models or traditional tools (or generate a new image entirely).

### Traditional non-AI upscaling

For cases where you need simple, deterministic upscaling without AI enhancement:

|---|---|
| Magnific Precise | ~40s |
| WaveSpeed SeedVR2 | ~40s |
| Magnific Creative | ~50s |
| Magnific Skin Enhancer | ~60s |
| HitPaw | ~60s |
| Nano Banana Pro | ~80s |
| Topaz Image Enhance | ~100s |

## Additional tips

<Tip>
Model characteristics:
- **RealESRGAN**: General-purpose upscaling
- **BSRGAN**: Excels with text and sharp edges  
- **SwinIR**: Preserves natural textures, ideal for landscapes
</Tip>

1. **Chained Upscaling**: Combine multiple upscale nodes (e.g., 2x → 4x) for ultra-high magnification
2. **Hybrid Workflow**: Connect upscale nodes after generation for "generate+enhance" pipelines
3. **Comparative Testing**: Different models perform better on specific image types - test multiple options
