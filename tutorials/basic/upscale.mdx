## Why upscaling matters

- **Industry requirements for resolutions**: 4K/8K end results are widely required across VFX & Film, Marketing, E-commerce, Gaming, and Design industries, and requirements keep moving up.
- **Reframing**: When assets ship across different aspect ratios and placements, extra resolution headroom prevents quality loss after cropping or recomposition.
- **The AI content problem**: Generative AI has dramatically increased the speed of visual creation, but most AI assets today are still generated at 480–720p, and not production-ready at the pixel level: edges, micro-texture, faces/hands, compression artifacts, etc. This creates a new pipeline: Generation → Refinement/Fix → Upscale → Delivery.
- **Cost/time efficiency**: Generate or render smaller → upscale at the end. This is a standard efficiency move in pipelines under budget/time pressure.

## What is image upscaling?

Image Upscaling is the process of converting low-resolution images to high-resolution using algorithms.
Unlike traditional interpolation methods, AI upscaling models (like ESRGAN) can intelligently reconstruct details while maintaining image quality.

For instance, the default SD1.5 model often struggles with large-size image generation. 
To achieve high-resolution results, we typically generate smaller images first and then use upscaling techniques.

This article covers one of many upscaling methods in ComfyUI. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through:
1. Downloading and installing upscaling models
2. Performing basic image upscaling
3. Combining text-to-image workflows with upscaling

## Key concepts

### Upscaling vs. enhancement

- **Upscaling** → increases resolution while reconstructing detail
- **Enhancement** → improves perceived quality (denoise, sharpen, restore, color, faces, etc.)

The best practice in AI pipelines usually combines both steps.

### Creative upscale vs. conservative upscale

Diffusion models and generative AI changed what "upscaling" means. Traditionally, super-resolution aimed to **preserve the original signal**. Today, some models can **re-imagine details that never existed**. And there are models approaching different balances between the two.

| | Conservative | Creative |
|---|---|---|
| **Goal** | Preserve the original | Reimagine and enhance |
| **Strengths** | High accuracy, Consistency, Production-safe | Rich details, Sharper, More visually striking |
| **Limits** | Can appear flat, limited improvement on poor input | Possible hallucinations or structural drift |
| **Models** | Magnific Precise, SeedVR2, FlashVSR, Topaz Fast, HitPaw | Wan 2.2, Magnific Creative, Topaz Astra Creative, HitPaw |

## Upscaling Workflow

### Model Installation

Required ESRGAN models download:
<Steps>
<Step title="Visit OpenModelDB">
Visit [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/) to search and download upscaling models (e.g., RealESRGAN)

![openmodeldb](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale_OpenModelDB.jpg)

As shown:
1. Filter models by image type using the category selector
2. The model's magnification factor is indicated in the top-right corner (e.g., 2x in the screenshot)

We'll use the [4x-ESRGAN](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-ESRGAN) model for this tutorial. Click the `Download` button on the model detail page.

</Step>
<Step title="Save Model Files in Directory">
Save the model file (.pth) in `ComfyUI/models/upscale_models` directory
</Step>
</Steps>


### Workflow and Assets

Download and drag the following image into ComfyUI to load the basic upscaling workflow:
![Upscale workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/image/basic/upscale_workflow.png)

<Tip>
Images containing workflow JSON in their metadata can be directly dragged into ComfyUI or loaded using the menu `Workflows` -> `Open (ctrl+o)`.
</Tip>

Use this image in smaller size as input:
![Upscale-input](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale-input.jpg)

### Complete the Workflow Step by Step

Follow the steps in the diagram below to ensure the workflow runs correctly.

![Upscale workflow](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale_simple_workflow.jpg)

1. Ensure `Load Upscale Model` loads `4x-ESRGAN.pth`
2. Upload the input image to the `Load Image` node
3. Click the `Queue` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to generate the image

The core components are the `Load Upscale Model` and `Upscale Image (Using Model)` nodes, which receive an image input and upscale it using the selected model.

## Text-to-Image Combined Workflow

After mastering basic upscaling, we can combine it with the [text-to-image](/tutorials/basic/text-to-image) workflow. For text-to-image basics, refer to the [text-to-image tutorial](/tutorials/basic/text-to-image).

Download and drag this image into ComfyUI to load the combined workflow:
![Text-to-image upscale workflow](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/esrgan_example.png)

This workflow connects the text-to-image output image directly to the upscaling nodes for final processing.

## Additional Tips

<Tip>
Model characteristics:
- **RealESRGAN**: General-purpose upscaling
- **BSRGAN**: Excels with text and sharp edges  
- **SwinIR**: Preserves natural textures, ideal for landscapes
</Tip>

1. **Chained Upscaling**: Combine multiple upscale nodes (e.g., 2x → 4x) for ultra-high magnification
2. **Hybrid Workflow**: Connect upscale nodes after generation for "generate+enhance" pipelines
3. **Comparative Testing**: Different models perform better on specific image types - test multiple options
