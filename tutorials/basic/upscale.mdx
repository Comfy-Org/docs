## What is Image Upscaling

Image Upscaling is the process of converting low-resolution images to high-resolution using algorithms. Unlike traditional interpolation methods, AI upscaling models (like ESRGAN) can intelligently reconstruct details while maintaining image quality. For instance, the default SD1.5 model often struggles with large-size image generation. To achieve high-resolution results, we typically generate smaller images first and then use upscaling techniques.

This article covers one of many upscaling methods in ComfyUI. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through:
- Downloading and installing upscaling models
- Performing basic image upscaling
- Combining text-to-image workflows with upscaling

## Download and Install Upscale Models

Required ESRGAN models download:
<Steps>
<Step title="Visit OpenModelDB">
Visit [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/) to search and download upscaling models (e.g., RealESRGAN)

![openmodeldb](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale_OpenModelDB.jpg)

As shown:
1. Filter models by image type using the category selector
2. The model's magnification factor is indicated in the top-right corner (e.g., 2x in the screenshot)

We'll use the [4x-ESRGAN](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-ESRGAN) model for this tutorial. Click the `Download` button on the model detail page.

</Step>
<Step title="Place Model Files in Directory">
2. Place the model file (.pth) in `ComfyUI/models/upscale_models` directory
</Step>
</Steps>

## Basic Upscaling Workflow

### 1. Workflow and Materials

Download and drag the following image into ComfyUI to load the basic upscaling workflow:
![Upscale workflow](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale_workflow.png)

Use this image as input:
![Upscale-input](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale-input.jpg)

### 2. Workflow Explanation

![Upscale workflow](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/upscale_simple_workflow.jpg)

1. Select the downloaded upscale model in the `Load Upscale Model` node
2. Choose the input image in the `Load Image` node
3. Click the `Queue` button or use `Ctrl + Enter` shortcut to execute

The core components are the `Load Upscale Model` and `Upscale Image (Using Model)` nodes, which receive an image input and upscale it using the selected model.

## Text-to-Image Combined Workflow

After mastering basic upscaling, we can combine it with the [text-to-image](/en-US/tutorials/basic/text-to-image.mdx) workflow. For text-to-image basics, refer to the [text-to-image tutorial](/en-US/tutorials/basic/text-to-image.mdx).

Download and drag this image into ComfyUI to load the combined workflow:
![Text-to-image upscale workflow](/images/tutorial/basic/upscale/esrgan_example.png)

This workflow connects the text-to-image output directly to the upscaling nodes for final processing.

## Additional Tips

<Tip>
Model characteristics:
- **RealESRGAN**: General-purpose upscaling
- **BSRGAN**: Excels with text and sharp edges  
- **SwinIR**: Preserves natural textures, ideal for landscapes
</Tip>

1. **Chained Upscaling**: Combine multiple upscale nodes (e.g., 2x â†’ 4x) for ultra-high magnification
2. **Hybrid Workflow**: Connect upscale nodes after generation for "generate+enhance" pipelines
3. **Comparative Testing**: Different models perform better on specific image types - test multiple options
