**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** is an efficient technique for fine-tuning large generative models like Stable Diffusion.
It introduces trainable low-rank matrices to the pre-trained model, adjusting only a portion of parameters rather than retraining the entire model,
thus achieving optimization for specific tasks at a lower computational cost.
Compared to base models like SD1.5, LoRA models are smaller and easier to train.

![LoRA Model vs Base Model Comparison](/images/tutorial/basic/lora/compare.png)

The image above compares generation with the same parameters using [dreamshaper_8](https://civitai.com/models/4384?modelVersionId=128713) directly versus using the [blindbox_V1Mix](https://civitai.com/models/25995/blindbox) LoRA model. 
As you can see, by using a LoRA model, we can generate images in different styles without adjusting the base model.

We will demonstrate how to use a LoRA model. All LoRA variants: Lycoris, loha, lokr, locon, etc... are used in the same way.

In this example, we will learn how to load and use a LoRA model in [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), covering the following topics:

1. Installing a LoRA model
2. Generating images using a LoRA model
3. A simple introduction to the `Load LoRA` node

## Required Model Installation

Download the [dreamshaper_8.safetensors](https://civitai.com/api/download/models/128713?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=pruned&fp=fp16) file and put it in your `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` folder.

Download the [blindbox_V1Mix.safetensors](https://civitai.com/api/download/models/32988?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=full&fp=fp16) file and put it in your `ComfyUI/models/loras` folder.

## LoRA Workflow File

Download the image below and **drag it into ComfyUI** to load the workflow.
![ComfyUI Workflow - LoRA](/images/tutorial/basic/lora/lora.png)

<Tip>
Images containing workflow JSON in their metadata can be directly dragged into ComfyUI or loaded using the menu `Workflows` -> `Open (ctrl+o)`.
</Tip>

## Complete the Workflow Step by Step

Follow the steps in the diagram below to ensure the workflow runs correctly.

![ComfyUI Workflow - LoRA Flow Diagram](/images/tutorial/basic/lora/flow_diagram.png)

1. Ensure `Load Checkpoint` loads `dreamshaper_8.safetensors`
2. Ensure `Load LoRA` loads `blindbox_V1Mix.safetensors`
3. Click the `Queue` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to generate the image

## Load LoRA Node Introduction

![Load LoRA Node](/images/comfy_core/loaders/load_lora.jpg)

Models in the `ComfyUI\models\loras` folder will be detected by ComfyUI and can be loaded using this node.

### Input Types

| Parameter Name   | Function                                                                                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `model`          | Connect to the base model                                                                              |
| `clip`           | Connect to the CLIP model                                                                              |
| `lora_name`      | Select the LoRA model to load and use                                                                  |
| `strength_model` | Affects how strongly the LoRA influences the model weights; higher values make the LoRA style stronger |
| `strength_clip`  | Affects how strongly the LoRA influences the CLIP text embeddings                                      |

### Output Types

| Parameter Name | Function                                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `model`        | Outputs the model with LoRA adjustments applied      |
| `clip`         | Outputs the CLIP model with LoRA adjustments applied |

This node supports chain connections, allowing multiple `Load LoRA` nodes to be linked in series to apply multiple LoRA models. For more details, please refer to [ComfyUI Multiple LoRAs Example](/tutorials/basic/multiple-loras)

## Try It Yourself

1. Try modifying the prompt or adjusting different parameters of the `Load LoRA` node, such as `strength_model`, to observe changes in the generated images and become familiar with the `Load LoRA` node.
2. Visit [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models) to download other kinds of LoRA models and try using them.
