In our [ComfyUI LoRA Example](/tutorials/basic/lora), we introduced how to load and use a single LoRA model, mentioning the node's chain connection capability.

This tutorial demonstrates chaining multiple `Load LoRA` nodes to apply two LoRA models simultaneously: [blindbox_V1Mix](https://civitai.com/models/25995?modelVersionId=32988) and [MoXinV1](https://civitai.com/models/12597?modelVersionId=14856).

The comparison below shows individual effects of these LoRAs using identical parameters:

By chaining multiple LoRA models, we achieve a blended style in the final output:

## Model Installation

Download the [dreamshaper_8.safetensors](https://civitai.com/api/download/models/128713?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=pruned&fp=fp16) file and put it in your `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` folder.

Download the [blindbox_V1Mix.safetensors](https://civitai.com/api/download/models/32988?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=full&fp=fp16) file and put it in your `ComfyUI/models/loras` folder.

Download the [MoXinV1.safetensors](https://civitai.com/api/download/models/14856?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=full&fp=fp16) file and put it in your `ComfyUI/models/loras` folder.

## Multi-LoRA Workflow

Download the image below and **drag it into ComfyUI** to load the workflow:

<Tip>
Images containing workflow JSON in their metadata can be directly dragged into ComfyUI or loaded using the menu `Workflows` -> `Open (ctrl+o)`.
</Tip>

## Complete the Workflow Step by Step

Follow the steps in the diagram below to ensure the workflow runs correctly.

![Multi-LoRA Workflow Diagram](/images/tutorial/basic/multiple_loras/flow_diagram.png)

1. Ensure `Load Checkpoint` loads  **dreamshaper_8.safetensors**
2. Ensure first `Load LoRA` loads **blindbox_V1Mix.safetensors**
3. Ensure second `Load LoRA` loads **MoXinV1.safetensors**
4. Click `Queue` or press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` to generate

## Try It Yourself

1. Adjust `strength_model` values in both `Load LoRA` nodes to control each LoRA's influence
2. Explore [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models) for additional LoRAs and create custom combinations
