This tutorial will guide you through the concept of outpainting in AI image generation and help you implement an outpainting workflow in ComfyUI. We'll cover:
- Using outpainting workflow to expand images
- Understanding and utilizing outpainting-related nodes in ComfyUI
- Mastering the basic operational workflow of outpainting

## About Outpainting

In AI image generation, we often encounter situations where an existing image has good composition but limited scope, requiring canvas expansion to create a larger scene. This is where outpainting comes into play.

Think of it as asking a **painter (AI model)** to extend an existing artwork outward. We need to specify the **direction and extent** of expansion, and the AI will logically extend the scene based on existing content. The core concept is similar to [inpainting](/tutorials/basic/inpaint), but we use different nodes to **construct the mask**.

Common applications of outpainting include:
- **Scene expansion:** Enlarging the original scene to show a more complete environment
- **Composition adjustment:** Optimizing overall composition through canvas extension
- **Content enhancement:** Adding more relevant scene elements to the original image

## ComfyUI Outpainting Workflow Walkthrough

### Preparation

#### 1. Model Installation

#### 2. Input Image

Prepare an image you want to expand. In this example, we'll use the following image:
