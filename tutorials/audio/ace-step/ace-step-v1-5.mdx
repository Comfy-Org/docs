## About ACE-Step 1.5 in ComfyUI

ACE-Step 1.5 is a major update to the open-source music generation model, now natively supported in ComfyUI. It brings commercial-grade quality to your local machine with a novel hybrid architecture where a Language Model acts as an omni-capable planner, transforming simple user queries into comprehensive song blueprints.

**ACE-Step 1.5 Model highlights:**
- **Commercial-grade quality**: Achieves quality beyond most commercial music models, scoring 4.72 on musical coherence
- **Blazing fast generation**: Generate a full 4-minute song in ~1 second on RTX 5090, or under 10 seconds on RTX 3090 with ComfyUI
- **50+ language support**: Strong support for English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, German, French, Portuguese, Italian, and Russian
- **LoRA fine-tuning**: Supports lightweight personalization through LoRA training in ComfyUI

## Option 1: All-in-One Checkpoint (Recommended)

The AIO version packages all models into a single checkpoint file, making it easier to download and manage.

## Key Features

### Chain-of-Thought Planning

The model synthesizes metadata, lyrics, and captions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning to guide the diffusion process, resulting in more coherent long-form compositions.

### Hybrid LM + DiT Architecture

ACE-Step 1.5 combines a Language Model that plans the song structure with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) that handles audio synthesis.

### LoRA Fine-Tuning

With just a few songs, you can train a LoRA that captures a specific style. Because you run it locally, you own the LoRA and don't have to worry about data leakage.

## Coming Soon

These features are available in ACE-Step 1.5 but not yet supported in ComfyUI:

- **Cover**: Give the model any song as input along with a new prompt and lyrics, and it will reimagine the track in a completely different style
- **Repaint**: Select a segment, regenerate just that section, and the model stitches it back in while keeping everything else untouched
