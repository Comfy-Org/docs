ACE-Step is an open-source foundational music generation model jointly developed by Chinese team StepFun and ACE Studio, aimed at providing music creators with efficient, flexible and high-quality music generation and editing tools.

The model is released under the [Apache-2.0](https://github.com/ace-step/ACE-Step?tab=readme-ov-file#-license) license and is free for commercial use.

As a powerful music generation foundation, ACE-Step provides rich extensibility. Through fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and ControlNet, developers can customize the model according to their actual needs.
Whether it's audio editing, vocal synthesis, accompaniment production, voice cloning or style transfer applications, ACE-Step provides stable and reliable technical support.
This flexible architecture greatly simplifies the development process of music AI applications, allowing more creators to quickly apply AI technology to music creation.

## ACE-Step ComfyUI Text-to-Audio Generation Workflow Example

### 1. Download Workflow and Related Models

Click the button below to download the corresponding workflow file. Drag it into ComfyUI to load the workflow information. The workflow includes model download information.

<a className="prose"  download href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/main/audio/ace-step/ace_step_1_t2m.json" style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#0078D6', color: '#ffffff', padding: '10px 20px', borderRadius: '8px', borderColor: "transparent", textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
    <p className="prose" style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: "0.8rem" }}>Download Json Format Workflow File</p>
</a>

You can also manually download [ace_step_v1_3.5b.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/ACE-Step_ComfyUI_repackaged/blob/main/all_in_one/ace_step_v1_3.5b.safetensors) and save it to the `ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` folder

### 2. Complete the Workflow Step by Step

![Step Guide](/images/tutorial/audio/ace_step/ace_step_1_t2a_step_guide.jpg)
1. Ensure the `Load Checkpoints` node has loaded the `ace_step_v1_3.5b.safetensors` model
2. (Optional) Input corresponding music styles etc. in the `tags` field of `TextEncodeAceStepAudio`
3. (Optional) Input corresponding lyrics in the `lyrics` field of `TextEncodeAceStepAudio`
4. Click the `Run` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to execute the generation
5. After the API returns results, you can view the generated audio in the `Save Audio` node. You can click to play and preview. The audio will also be saved to `ComfyUI/output/audio` (subdirectory determined by the `Save Audio` node).

You can find rich examples of `tags` and `lyrics` on the [ACE-Step Model Homepage](https://ace-step.github.io/) for reference.
<Tip>
- ACE-Step V1 supports multiple languages. When used, ACE-Step will convert different languages into English letters before generating music.
- In ComfyUI, we haven't fully implemented the conversion of all languages to English letters. Currently only [Japanese](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/commit/5d3cc85e13833aeb6ef9242cdae243083e30c6fc) is implemented.
So if you need to use multiple languages for music generation, you need to first convert the language to English letters, then input the language code abbreviation at the beginning of `lyrics`, such as Chinese `[zh]` Korean `[ko]` etc.
For example:

```
[zh]ni hao
[ko]an nyeong
```
