[Flux.1 Krea Dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev) is an advanced text-to-image generation model developed in collaboration between Black Forest Labs (BFL) and Krea. This is currently the best open-source FLUX model, specifically designed for text-to-image generation.

**Model Features**

- **Unique Aesthetic Style**: Focuses on generating images with unique aesthetics, avoiding common "AI look" appearance
- **Natural Details**: Does not produce blown-out highlights, maintaining natural detail representatio
- **Exceptional Realism**: Provides outstanding realism and image quality
- **Fully Compatible Architecture**: Fully compatible architecture design with FLUX.1 [dev]

**Model License**
This model is released under the [flux-1-dev-non-commercial-license](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev/blob/main/LICENSE.md)

## Flux.1 Krea Dev ComfyUI Workflow

<UpdateReminder />

#### 1. Workflow Files

Download the image or JSON below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the corresponding workflow

<a className="prose"  target='_blank'  href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/workflow_templates/refs/heads/main/templates/flux1_krea_dev.json" style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#0078D6', color: '#ffffff', padding: '10px 20px', borderRadius: '8px', borderColor: "transparent", textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
    <p className="prose" style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: "0.8rem" }}>Download JSON Workflow</p>
</a>

#### 2. Manual Model Installation

Please download the following model files:
**Diffusion model**

- [flux1-krea-dev_fp8_scaled.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/FLUX.1-Krea-dev_ComfyUI/blob/main/split_files/diffusion_models/flux1-krea-dev_fp8_scaled.safetensors)

If you want to pursue higher quality and have enough VRAM, you can try the original model weights

- [flux1-krea-dev.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev/resolve/main/flux1-krea-dev.safetensors) 

<Note>
The `flux1-dev.safetensors` file requires agreeing to the [black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Krea-dev/) agreement before downloading via browser.
</Note>

If you have used Flux related workflows before, the following models are the same and don't need to be downloaded again

**Text encoders**
- [clip_l.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/clip_l.safetensors?download=true)
- [t5xxl_fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/t5xxl_fp16.safetensors?download=true) Recommended when your VRAM is greater than 32GB.
- [t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/comfyanonymous/flux_text_encoders/resolve/main/t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors)  For Low VRAM

**VAE**
- [ae.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell/resolve/main/ae.safetensors?download=true)

#### 3. Step-by-step Verification to Ensure Workflow Runs Properly

<Tip>
    For low VRAM users, this model may not run smoothly on your device, you can wait for the community to provide FP8 or GGUF version.
</Tip>

Please refer to the image below to ensure all model files have been loaded correctly

![ComfyUI Flux Krea Dev Workflow](/images/tutorial/flux/flux_1_krea_dev_guide.jpg)

1. Ensure that `flux1-krea-dev_fp8_scaled.safetensors` or `flux1-krea-dev.safetensors` is loaded in the `Load Diffusion Model` node
    - `flux1-krea-dev_fp8_scaled.safetensors` is recommended for low VRAM users
    - `flux1-krea-dev.safetensors` is the original weights, if you have enough VRAM like 24GB you can use it for better quality
2. Ensure the following models are loaded in the `DualCLIPLoader` node:
   - clip_name1: t5xxl_fp16.safetensors or t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors
   - clip_name2: clip_l.safetensors
3. Ensure that `ae.safetensors` is loaded in the `Load VAE` node
4. Click the `Queue` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow
