## About FLUX.2

[FLUX.2](https://bfl.ai/blog/flux-2) is a next-generation image model from [Black Forest Labs](https://blackforestlabs.ai/), delivering up to 4MP photorealistic output with far better lighting, skin, fabric, and hand detail. It adds reliable multi-reference consistency (up to 10 images), improved editing precision, better visual understanding, and professional-class text rendering.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Reference Consistency:** Reliably maintains identity, product geometry, textures, materials, wardrobe, and composition intent across multiple outputs
- **High-Resolution Photorealism:** Generates images up to 4MP with real-world lighting behavior, spatial reasoning, and physics-aware detail
- **Professional-Grade Control:** Exact pose control, hex-code accurate brand colors, any aspect ratio, and structured prompting for programmatic workflows
- **Usable Text Rendering:** Produces clean, legible text across UI screens, infographics, and multi-language content

**Available Models:**
- **FLUX.2 Dev:** Open-source model (used in this tutorial)
- **FLUX.2 Pro:** API version from Black Forest Labs
