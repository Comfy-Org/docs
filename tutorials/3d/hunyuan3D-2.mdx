# Hunyuan3D 2.0 Introduction

![Hunyuan 3D 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2/main/assets/images/teaser.jpg)

[Hunyuan3D 2.0](https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2) is an open-source 3D asset generation model released by Tencent, capable of generating high-fidelity 3D models with high-resolution texture maps through text or images.

Hunyuan3D 2.0 adopts a two-stage generation approach, first generating a geometry model without textures, then synthesizing high-resolution texture maps. This effectively separates the complexity of shape and texture generation. Below are the two core components of Hunyuan3D 2.0:

1. **Geometry Generation Model (Hunyuan3D-DiT)**: Based on a flow diffusion Transformer architecture, it generates untextured geometric models that precisely match input conditions.
2. **Texture Generation Model (Hunyuan3D-Paint)**: Combines geometric conditions and multi-view diffusion techniques to add high-resolution textures to models, supporting PBR materials.

Recently (March 18, 2025), Hunyuan3D 2.0 also introduced a multi-view shape generation model (Hunyuan3D-2mv), which supports generating more detailed geometric structures from inputs at different angles.

**Key Advantages**

- **High-Precision Generation**: Sharp geometric structures, rich texture colors, support for PBR material generation, achieving near-realistic lighting effects.
- **Diverse Usage Methods**: Provides code calls, Blender plugins, Gradio applications, and online experience through the official website, suitable for different user needs.
- **Lightweight and Compatibility**: The Hunyuan3D-2mini model requires only 5GB VRAM, the standard version needs 6GB VRAM for shape generation, and the complete process (shape + texture) requires only 12GB VRAM.

Next, we will complete a 3D generation workflow in ComfyUI using Hunyuan3D-2mv in this example.

<Note>
ComfyUI now natively supports Hunyuan3D-2. Please make sure you have upgraded to the latest version of [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) before starting.

## ComfyUI Hunyuan3D-2mv Workflow Examples

### 1. Workflow
Please download the image below and drag it into ComfyUI to load the workflow. We will also use this image as the input condition.
![input image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/main/3d/hunyuan3d-2mv/alien_schnerck.png)

### 2. Manual Models Installation
Download the models below and save them to the corresponding ComfyUI folders

<Tip>
Since all versions of the hunyuan3d-v2-mv model (full version, fast, or turbo version) use the filename `model.fp16.safetensors`, it's recommended to rename the file after downloading for easier identification.
</Tip>

- hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv: [model.fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan3D-2mv/resolve/main/hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv/model.fp16.safetensors?download=true) - after downloading, you can rename it to `hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv.safetensors`

```
ComfyUI/
├── models/
│   ├── checkpoints/
│   │   └── hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv.safetensors  // renamed file
```

### 3. Steps to Run the Workflow

![Workflow Steps](/images/tutorial/3d/hunyuan3d-2mv/flow_diagram_hunyuan_3d_v2_mv.png)

1. Ensure that the Image Only Checkpoint Loader(img2vid model) has loaded our downloaded and renamed `hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv.safetensors` model
2. Load our prepared image in the `Load Image` node
3. Click the `Queue` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow

The generated model will be output to the `ComfyUI/output/mesh` folder. You can use ComfyUI's `Load 3D` node to load and preview it.

<Tip>
The mv (multi-view) version model supports generating more detailed geometric structures from different perspective inputs. You can try using images from multiple angles to control and generate more precise models.
