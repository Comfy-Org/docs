# Hunyuan3D 2.0 Introduction

![Hunyuan 3D 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2/main/assets/images/e2e-1.gif)

[Hunyuan3D 2.0](https://github.com/Tencent/Hunyuan3D-2) is an open-source 3D asset generation model released by Tencent, capable of generating high-fidelity 3D models with high-resolution texture maps through text or images.

Hunyuan3D 2.0 adopts a two-stage generation approach, first generating a geometry model without textures, then synthesizing high-resolution texture maps. This effectively separates the complexity of shape and texture generation. Below are the two core components of Hunyuan3D 2.0:

1. **Geometry Generation Model (Hunyuan3D-DiT)**: Based on a flow diffusion Transformer architecture, it generates untextured geometric models that precisely match input conditions.
2. **Texture Generation Model (Hunyuan3D-Paint)**: Combines geometric conditions and multi-view diffusion techniques to add high-resolution textures to models, supporting PBR materials.


**Key Advantages**

- **High-Precision Generation**: Sharp geometric structures, rich texture colors, support for PBR material generation, achieving near-realistic lighting effects.
- **Diverse Usage Methods**: Provides code calls, Blender plugins, Gradio applications, and online experience through the official website, suitable for different user needs.
- **Lightweight and Compatibility**: The Hunyuan3D-2mini model requires only 5GB VRAM, the standard version needs 6GB VRAM for shape generation, and the complete process (shape + texture) requires only 12GB VRAM.

Recently (March 18, 2025), Hunyuan3D 2.0 also introduced a multi-view shape generation model (Hunyuan3D-2mv), which supports generating more detailed geometric structures from inputs at different angles.

This example includes three workflows:
- Using Hunyuan3D-2mv with multiple view inputs to generate 3D models
- Using Hunyuan3D-2mv-turbo with multiple view inputs to generate 3D models
- Using Hunyuan3D-2 with a single view input to generate 3D models

<Tip>
ComfyUI now natively supports Hunyuan3D-2mv, but does not yet support texture and material generation. Please make sure you have updated to the latest version of [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) before starting.

The workflow example PNG images in this tutorial contain workflow JSON in their metadata:
- You can drag them directly into ComfyUI
- Or use the menu `Workflows` -> `Open (ctrl+o)`

This will load the corresponding workflow and prompt you to download the required models. The generated `.glb` format models will be output to the `ComfyUI/output/mesh` folder.
</Tip>

## ComfyUI Hunyuan3D-2mv Workflow Example

In the Hunyuan3D-2mv workflow, we'll use multi-view images to generate a 3D model. Note that multiple view images are not mandatory in this workflow - you can use only the `front` view image to generate a 3D model.

<UpdateReminder/>

### 1. Workflow

Please download the images below and drag  into ComfyUI to load the workflow.
![Hunyuan3D-2mv workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/main/3d/hunyuan3d-2/hunyuan3d_2mv_elf/hunyuan-3d-multiview-elf.webp)

Download the images below we will use them as input images.

![input image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/main/3d/hunyuan3d-2/hunyuan3d_2mv_elf/front.png)
![input image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/main/3d/hunyuan3d-2/hunyuan3d_2mv_elf/left.png)
![input image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/main/3d/hunyuan3d-2/hunyuan3d_2mv_elf/back.png)


<Tip>
In this example, the input images have already been preprocessed to remove excess background. In actual use, you can use custom nodes like [ComfyUI_essentials](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials) to automatically remove excess background.

### 2. Manual Model Installation

Download the model below and save it to the corresponding ComfyUI folder

- hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv: [model.fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hunyuan3D-2mv/resolve/main/hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv/model.fp16.safetensors?download=true) - after downloading, you can rename it to `hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv.safetensors`

```
ComfyUI/
├── models/
│   ├── checkpoints/
│   │   └── hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv.safetensors  // renamed file
```

### 3. Steps to Run the Workflow

![ComfyUI hunyuan3d_2mv](/images/tutorial/3d/hunyuan3d-2mv/hunyuan3d_2mv.jpg)

1. Ensure that the Image Only Checkpoint Loader(img2vid model) has loaded our downloaded and renamed `hunyuan3d-dit-v2-mv.safetensors` model
2. Load the corresponding view images in each of the `Load Image` nodes
3. Click the `Queue` button, or use the shortcut `Ctrl(cmd) + Enter` to run the workflow

If you need to add more views, make sure to load other view images in the `Hunyuan3Dv2ConditioningMultiView` node, and ensure that you load the corresponding view images in the `Load Image` nodes.

## Hunyuan3D-2mv-turbo Workflow

In the Hunyuan3D-2mv-turbo workflow, we'll use the Hunyuan3D-2mv-turbo model to generate 3D models. This model is a step distillation version of Hunyuan3D-2mv, allowing for faster 3D model generation. In this version of the workflow, we set `cfg` to 1.0 and add a `flux guidance` node to control the `distilled cfg` generation.

### 1. Workflow

Please download the images below and drag into ComfyUI to load the workflow.

## Hunyuan3D-2 Single View Workflow

In the Hunyuan3D-2 workflow, we'll use the Hunyuan3D-2 model to generate 3D models. This model is not a multi-view model. In this workflow, we use the `Hunyuan3Dv2Conditioning` node instead of the `Hunyuan3Dv2ConditioningMultiView` node.
