There are many reasons you might have issues installing ComfyUI. Maybe a network connection failed when installing pytorch (15 GB). Or you don’t have git installed. The maintenance page automatically opens when it detects an issue and provides a way to resolve the issue.

You can use it to resolve most issues:

- Create a python virtual environment
- Reinstall all missing core dependencies to your Python virtual environment that’s managed by Desktop
- Install git, VC redis
- Choose a new install location

The default maintenance page displays the current error content
