## Adding External Model Paths

If you have models stored in other locations on your computer outside the ComfyUI installation directory, you can add them to ComfyUI by configuring the `extra_models_config.yaml` file.

For ComfyUI Desktop, this file is located at:
- On Windows: `C:\Users\<YOUR_USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\ComfyUI\extra_models_config.yaml`
- On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI/extra_models_config.yaml`
- On Linux: `~/.config/ComfyUI/extra_models_config.yaml`

For detailed instructions, see [Models documentation](/development/core-concepts/models#adding-external-model-paths)
