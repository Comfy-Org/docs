## Important: Do not modify the resource/ComfyUI folder

<Warning>
Do not add or modify any content in the `/resource/ComfyUI` folder. All content in this folder will be reset when ComfyUI Desktop updates.

Unlike other ComfyUI versions, the Desktop version manages this folder automatically. During installation, you chose a custom location for your models, custom nodes, and other user files - please use that location instead.
</Warning>
