## Desktop Python Environment

The desktop installation will create a Python virtual environment in your chosen installation directory, typically a hidden `.venv` folder.

If you need to handle dependencies for ComfyUI plugins, you'll need to do so within this environment. Using the system command line directly risks installing dependencies to the system environment, so please follow the instructions below to activate the appropriate environment.

### How to use the Desktop Python environment?

    1. Click the icon in the menu bar to open the bottom panel
    2. Click `Terminal` to open the terminal
    3. Type `which python` in the terminal to check the current Python installation location

    You can then perform dependency installation operations here.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Terminal">
    You can also use your preferred terminal to access the Python environment, but you'll need to activate the virtual environment first.

    <Warning>
    When using other terminals, if you're not familiar with the operations, you may accidentally install dependencies to the system environment. Please use this method with caution.
    </Warning>

    In the screenshot, it shows a macOS terminal. If you are using Windows, please refer to the following steps to activate the virtual environment on your system.    
    </Warning>
    <Steps>
        <Step title="Open Terminal">
            Open your preferred terminal and use the `cd` command to navigate to your ComfyUI installation directory, for example:
            ```
            cd <your comfyui install directory>/ComfyUI
            ```
        </Step>
        <Step title="Activate Virtual Environment">
            Type the following command in the terminal to activate the virtual environment

            <Tabs>
              <Tab title="Windows">
                ```
                .venv/Scripts/activate
                ```
              </Tab>
              <Tab title="macOS">
                ```
                source .venv/bin/activate
                ```
              </Tab>
            </Tabs>
           
            After activation, you should see a prompt like `(ComfyUI)` in the terminal, indicating that you've activated the virtual environment.
        </Step>
        <Step title="Confirm Current Python Environment">
            Use `which python` to check the current Python installation location and confirm it's not the system environment.
        </Step>
        
        After completing these steps, you've activated the corresponding Python environment, and you can continue to perform dependency installation operations in this environment.
