### Adding External Model Paths

If you downloaded a model but ComfyUI cannot find it, you may need to add an additional model search path to the yaml file.

#### Example scenario
You need to add a motion LoRA and your model is located in `C:\Users\YourUsername\models\animatediff_motion_lora`.

#### Solution
1. Add the below line to the `extra_model_config.yaml` file
2. Restart ComfyUI

```yaml
additional_model_paths:
  animatediff_motion_lora: C:\Users\YourUsername\models\animatediff_motion_lora/
```

#### YAML config file locations
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\ComfyUI\extra_models_config.yaml`
- On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI/extra_models_config.yaml`
- On Linux: `~/.config/ComfyUI/extra_models_config.yaml`

#### Desktop Application Instructions
If you're using the ComfyUI Desktop application, you can locate the config file at:

- On Windows: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\ComfyUI\extra_models_config.yaml`
  - You can quickly navigate to this by typing `%APPDATA%\ComfyUI` in File Explorer address bar
- On macOS: Open Finder, press `Cmd+Shift+G` and enter `~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI`
- On Linux: Open your file manager and navigate to the hidden folder `~/.config/ComfyUI`

If the file doesn't exist yet, you can create it yourself with any text editor.
