## Adding Extra Model Paths

If you want to manage your model files outside of `ComfyUI/models`, you may have the following reasons:

- You have multiple ComfyUI instances and want them to share model files to save disk space
- You have different types of GUI programs (such as WebUI) and want them to use the same model files
- Model files cannot be recognized or found

We provide a way to add extra model search paths via the `extra_model_paths.yaml` configuration file.

### Open Config File

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Portable/Manual Install">
  For the ComfyUI version such as [portable](/installation/comfyui_portable_windows) and [manual](/installation/manual_install), you can find an example file named `extra_model_paths.yaml.example` in the root directory of ComfyUI:
  ``
  ComfyUI/extra_model_paths.yaml.example
  ``
  Please copy and rename it to `extra_model_paths.yaml` to use it.

  You can also find the config example file [here](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/extra_model_paths.yaml.example)
  
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Desktop Application">
  If you are using the [ComfyUI Desktop](/installation/desktop/windows) application, you can follow the image below to open the extra model config file:

  ![Open Config File](/images/desktop/extra_model_paths.jpg)

  Or open it directly at:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Windows">
      ```
      C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\ComfyUI\extra_models_config.yaml
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="macOS">
      ```
      ~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI/extra_models_config.yaml
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

If the file does not exist, you can create it yourself with any text editor.

### Example Structure

Suppose your model file structure is as follows:

```
üìÅ your_path/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅmodels/
  |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ lora/
  |   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xxxxx.safetensors
  |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ checkpoints/
  |   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xxxxx.safetensors
  |   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ vae/
  |   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xxxxx.safetensors
  |   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ controlnet/
  |       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xxxxx.safetensors
```

Then you can configure the `extra_model_paths.yaml` file like below to let ComfyUI recognize the model paths on your device:

```
my_custom_config:
  base_path: your_path
  loras: models/lora/
  checkpoints: models/checkpoints/
  vae: models/vae/
  controlnet: models/controlnet/
```

Or you can refer to the default [extra_model_paths.yaml.example](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/extra_model_paths.yaml.example) for more configuration options. After saving, you need to **restart ComfyUI** for the changes to take effect.

Below is the original config example:

```yaml
#Rename this to extra_model_paths.yaml and ComfyUI will load it


#config for a1111 ui
#all you have to do is change the base_path to where yours is installed
a111:
    base_path: path/to/stable-diffusion-webui/

    checkpoints: models/Stable-diffusion
    configs: models/Stable-diffusion
    vae: models/VAE
    loras: |
         models/Lora
         models/LyCORIS
    upscale_models: |
                  models/ESRGAN
                  models/RealESRGAN
                  models/SwinIR
    embeddings: embeddings
    hypernetworks: models/hypernetworks
    controlnet: models/ControlNet

#config for comfyui
#your base path should be either an existing comfy install or a central folder where you store all of your models, loras, etc.

#comfyui:
#     base_path: path/to/comfyui/
#     # You can use is_default to mark that these folders should be listed first, and used as the default dirs for eg downloads
#     #is_default: true
#     checkpoints: models/checkpoints/
#     clip: models/clip/
#     clip_vision: models/clip_vision/
#     configs: models/configs/
#     controlnet: models/controlnet/
#     diffusion_models: |
#                  models/diffusion_models
#                  models/unet
#     embeddings: models/embeddings/
#     loras: models/loras/
#     upscale_models: models/upscale_models/
#     vae: models/vae/

#other_ui:
#    base_path: path/to/ui
#    checkpoints: models/checkpoints
#    gligen: models/gligen
#    custom_nodes: path/custom_nodes

```

For example, if your WebUI is located at `D:\stable-diffusion-webui\`, you can modify the corresponding configuration to
```yaml
a111:
    base_path: D:\stable-diffusion-webui\
    checkpoints: models/Stable-diffusion
    configs: models/Stable-diffusion
    vae: models/VAE
    loras: |
         models/Lora
         models/LyCORIS
    upscale_models: |
                  models/ESRGAN
                  models/RealESRGAN
                  models/SwinIR
    embeddings: embeddings
    hypernetworks: models/hypernetworks
    controlnet: models/ControlNet
```
