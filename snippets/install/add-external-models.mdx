### Adding External Model Paths

If you downloaded a model but ComfyUI cannot find it, you may need to add an additional model search path to the yaml file.

#### Example scenario
You need to add a motion LoRA and your model is located in `C:\Users\YourUsername\models\animatediff_motion_lora`.

#### Solution
1. Add the below configuration to the `extra_model_paths.yaml` file using the correct model type property name
2. Restart ComfyUI

```yaml
my_custom_config:
  loras: C:\Users\YourUsername\models\animatediff_motion_lora/
```

**Important:** Use the correct property names for different model types:
- `loras` - for LoRA models
- `checkpoints` - for checkpoint models  
- `vae` - for VAE models
- `controlnet` - for ControlNet models
- `clip` - for CLIP models
- `upscale_models` - for upscaling models
- `embeddings` - for textual inversion embeddings
- `configs` - for configuration files

For example, to add checkpoint models:
```yaml
my_custom_config:
  checkpoints: C:\Users\YourUsername\models\checkpoints/
```

#### YAML config file location
For standard ComfyUI installations, create the `extra_model_paths.yaml` file directly in your ComfyUI folder (where `main.py` is located).

#### Desktop Application Instructions
If you're using the ComfyUI Desktop application, the config file has a different name and location:

- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\ComfyUI\extra_models_config.yaml`
  - You can quickly navigate to this by typing `%APPDATA%\ComfyUI` in File Explorer address bar
- On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI/extra_models_config.yaml`
  - Open Finder, press `Cmd+Shift+G` and enter `~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI`
- On Linux: `~/.config/ComfyUI/extra_models_config.yaml`
  - Open your file manager and navigate to the hidden folder `~/.config/ComfyUI`

If the file doesn't exist yet, you can create it yourself with any text editor.
