The ComfyUI user directory is where your personal settings, workflows, and customizations are stored. The location depends on your installation type:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Desktop - Windows">
```
C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\ComfyUI
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Desktop - macOS">
```
~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Desktop - Linux">
```
~/.config/ComfyUI
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Manual Install">
The user directory is located in your ComfyUI installation folder:
```
<ComfyUI installation path>/user
```

For example, if you cloned ComfyUI to `C:\ComfyUI`, your user directory would be `C:\ComfyUI\user`.
</Tab>
<Tab title="Portable">
The user directory is located in your ComfyUI portable folder:
```
<ComfyUI_windows_portable>/ComfyUI/user

This location contains your workflows, settings, and other user-specific files.
