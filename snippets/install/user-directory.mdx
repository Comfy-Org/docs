The ComfyUI user directory is where your personal settings, workflows, and customizations are stored. The location depends on whether you're using the desktop application or the standard installation:

## Desktop Application

### Windows
- `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Roaming\ComfyUI`

### macOS
- `~/Library/Application Support/ComfyUI`

### Linux
- `~/.config/ComfyUI`

## Standard Installation (Non-Desktop)

The user directory is located in the main ComfyUI installation folder:

- `<ComfyUI installation path>/user`

For example, if you cloned ComfyUI to `C:\ComfyUI`, your user directory would be `C:\ComfyUI\user`.

This location contains your workflows, settings, and other user-specific files.
