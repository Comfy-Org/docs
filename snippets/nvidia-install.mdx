Nvidia users should install stable pytorch using this command:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130
```

Alternatively, you can install the nightly version of PyTorch.

<Accordion title="Install Nightly">
<Warning>Install Nightly version (might be more risky)</Warning>

This is the command to install pytorch nightly instead which might have performance improvements:

```bash
pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu130
```

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting">
If you get the "Torch not compiled with CUDA enabled" error, uninstall torch with:

```bash
pip uninstall torch
```

And install it again with the command above.
