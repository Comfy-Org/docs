AMD users can install rocm and pytorch with pip if you don't have it already installed, this is the command to install the stable version:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm6.4
```

Alternatively, you can install the nightly version of PyTorch.

<Warning>Install Nightly version (might be more risky)</Warning>

This is the command to install the nightly with ROCm 7.0 which might have some performance improvements:

```bash
pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/rocm7.0
```
