    Make sure your ComfyUI is updated.
    - [Download ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/download)
    - [Update Guide](/installation/update_comfyui)

    Workflows in this guide can be found in the [Workflow Templates](/interface/features/template).
    If you can't find them in the template, your ComfyUI may be outdated. (Desktop version's update will delay sometime)

    If nodes are missing when loading a workflow, possible reasons:
    1. You are not using the latest ComfyUI version (Nightly version)
    2. Some nodes failed to import at startup
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Desktop users">
  The desktop is using auto-update, and it's always the latest version. 
  
  So, if you find that any core node is missing, please wait for the next stable release.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For cloud users">
    If you're using [cloud.comfy.org](https://cloud.comfy.org), all nodes and models are pre-configured and ready to use. You don't need to update anything or install custom nodes.
