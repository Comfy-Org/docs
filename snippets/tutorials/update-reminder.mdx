  <Tab title="Using local ComfyUI">
    Make sure your ComfyUI is updated.
    - [Download ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/download)
    - [Update Guide](/installation/update_comfyui)

    Workflows in this guide can be found in the [Workflow Templates](/interface/features/template).
    If you can't find them in the template, your ComfyUI may be outdated. (Desktop version's update will delay sometime)

    If nodes are missing when loading a workflow, possible reasons:
    1. You are not using the latest ComfyUI version (Nightly version)
    2. You are using Stable or Desktop version (Latest changes may not be included)
    3. Some nodes failed to import at startup

  <Tab title="Using cloud.comfy.org">
    If you're using [cloud.comfy.org](https://cloud.comfy.org), all nodes and models are pre-configured and ready to use. You don't need to update anything or install custom nodes.
