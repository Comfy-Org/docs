<Tip>
Make sure your ComfyUI is updated.
- [Download ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/download)
- [Update Guide](/installation/update_comfyui)

Workflows in this guide can be found in the [Workflow Templates](/interface/features/template).
If you can't find them in the template, your ComfyUI may be outdated.(Desktop version's update will delay sometime)

If nodes are missing when loading a workflow, possible reasons:
1. Not using the latest ComfyUI version(Nightly version)
2. Using Stable or Desktop version (Latest changes may not be included)
3. Some nodes failed to import at startup
