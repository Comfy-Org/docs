<Tip>
If you find missing nodes when loading the workflow file below, it may be due to the following situations:

1. You are not using the latest Development (Nightly) version of ComfyUI.
2. You are using the Stable (Release) version or Desktop version of ComfyUI (which does not include the latest feature updates).
3. You are using the latest Commit version of ComfyUI, but some nodes failed to import during startup.

Please make sure you have successfully updated ComfyUI to the latest Development (Nightly) version. See: [How to Update ComfyUI](/installation/update_comfyui) section to learn how to update ComfyUI.
