  <Accordion title="Why can't I find the API nodes?">
    Please update your ComfyUI to the latest version (the latest commit or the latest [desktop version](https://www.comfy.org/download)). 
    We may add more API support in the future, and the corresponding nodes will be updated, so please keep your ComfyUI up to date.

    <Tip>
    Please note that you need to distinguish between the nightly version and the release version.
    In some cases, the latest `release` version may not be updated in time compared to the `nightly` version.
    Since we are still iterating quickly, please ensure you are using the latest version when you cannot find the corresponding node.
    </Tip>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I use / log in to the API Nodes?">
    API access requires that your current request is based on a secure network environment. The current requirements for API access are as follows:
    - The local network only allows access from `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, which may mean that you cannot use the API Nodes in a ComfyUI service started with the `--listen` parameter in a LAN environment.
    - Able to access our API service normally (a proxy service may be required in some regions).
    - Your account does not have enough [credits](/interface/credits).
  </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="Why can't I use API node even after logging in, or why does it keep asking me to log in while using?">
    - Currently, only `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` access is supported.
    - Ensure your account has enough credits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can API Nodes be used for free?">
    API Nodes require credits for API calls to closed-source models, so they do not support free usage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to purchase credits?">
    Please refer to the following documentation:
    1. [Comfy Account](/interface/user): Find the `User` section in the settings menu to log in.
    2. [Credits](/interface/credits): After logging in, the settings interface will show the credits menu. You can purchase credits in `Settings` â†’ `Credits`. We use a prepaid system, so there will be no unexpected charges.
    3. Complete the payment through Stripe.
    4. Check if the credits have been updated. If not, try restarting or refreshing the page.
