## Prerequisites for Using API Nodes

To use API Nodes, the following requirements must be met:


### 1. ComfyUI Version Requirements

Please update your ComfyUI to the latest version, as we may add more API support in the future, and corresponding nodes will be updated, so please keep your ComfyUI up to date.

<Tip>
Please note the distinction between nightly and release versions. We recommend using the `nightly` version (which is the latest code commit), as the release version may not be updated in a timely manner. 
This refers to the development version and the stable version, and since we are still rapidly iterating, this document may not be updated promptly, so please pay attention to the version differences.
</Tip>

### 2. Account and Credits Requirements

You need to be logged into your ComfyUI with a [Comfy account](/interface/user) and have a credit balance of [credits](/interface/credits) greater than 0.

Log in via `Settings` -> `User`:

Go to `Settings` -> `Credits` to purchase credits

Please refer to the corresponding documentation for account and credits to ensure this requirement:
- [Comfy account](/interface/user): Find the `User` section in the settings menu to log in.
- [Credits](/interface/credits): After logging in, the settings interface will show a credits menu where you can purchase credits. We use a prepaid system, so there will be no unexpected charges.


### 3. Network Environment Requirements

API access requires that your current requests are based on a secure network environment. The current requirements for API access are as follows:

 - The local network only allows access from `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, and you can directly use the login function.
- If you are accessing from a local area network or a website that is not on the whitelist, please log in with an API Key. Please refer to [Log in with an API Key](/interface/user#logging-in-with-an-api-key).
- You should be able to access our API service normally (in some regions, you may need to use a proxy service).
- Access should be carried out in an `https` environment to ensure the security of the requests. 

<Note>
Accessing in an insecure context poses significant risks, which may result in the following consequences:
1. Authentication may be stolen, leading to the leakage of your account information.
2. Your account may be maliciously used, resulting in financial losses.

Even if we open this restriction in the future, we strongly advise against accessing API services through insecure network requests due to the high risks involved.
</Note>


### 4. Using the Corresponding Nodes

**Add to Workflow**: Add the API node to your workflow just like you would with other nodes.
**Run**: Set the parameters and then run the workflow.
