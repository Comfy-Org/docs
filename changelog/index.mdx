<Update label="v0.3.43" description="June 30, 2025">

**Enhanced Model Support & Workflow Reliability**

This release brings significant improvements to model compatibility and workflow stability:

- **Expanded Model Documentation**: Added comprehensive support documentation for Flux Kontext and Omnigen 2 models, making it easier for creators to integrate these powerful models into their workflows
- **VAE Encoding Improvements**: Removed unnecessary random noise injection during VAE encoding, resulting in more consistent and predictable outputs across workflow runs
- **Memory Management Fix**: Resolved a critical memory estimation bug specifically affecting Kontext model usage, preventing out-of-memory errors and improving workflow stability

These changes enhance the reliability of advanced model workflows while maintaining ComfyUI's flexibility for AI artists and researchers working with cutting-edge generative models.
