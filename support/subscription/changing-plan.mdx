## Billing for plan changes

### Upgrading to a higher-priced plan

If your current subscription plan price is lower than the target plan, you will need to pay the price difference. You will receive an equivalent credit amount corresponding to the price difference.

### Downgrading to a lower-priced plan

If your current subscription plan price is higher than the target plan, your subscription will switch to the new plan after the current billing cycle ends. The new subscription will be based on the new pricing plan.
