## What you can update

You can modify the following payment details:

- Credit or debit card number
- Card expiration date
- CVV/security code
- Billing address
- Payment method type (switch between card and digital wallet)

## When changes take effect

- Changes to your payment method take effect immediately
- Your next billing cycle will use the updated payment information
- Updates to billing details (name, address, tax ID) only apply to future invoices; existing invoices cannot be modified
- Active subscriptions will not be interrupted when you update payment details

## Important notes

- You must have an active payment method on file to maintain your subscription
- If you remove a payment method, you must add a new one before the next billing date
- Keep a copy of past invoices before making changes if you need them for record keeping
- Updating your payment information does not change your billing date or subscription plan

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues updating your payment information:

- Verify that all information is entered correctly
- Ensure your card has not expired
- Check that your billing address matches your card issuer's records
- Try using a different browser or clearing your cache
- Contact our [support team](https://support.comfy.org/) if problems persist
