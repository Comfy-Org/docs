We are currently iterating on a new standard for nodes in ComfyUI. There are 4 things that are being improved right now:

You can view the diff with the existing version [here](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/rfcs/compare/main...v3).

If you want to propose a change to any portion here, please make a PR to the v3 branch of the [rfcs](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/rfcs) repository.

This is a work in progress and will be updated frequently.

## pyproject.toml

This defines the manifest for a custom node pack and contains a lot of metadata.

## node_def.json

This defines the node definition for a single node in a workflow json.

## node_def.py

This is how you write a node as a Python class.

## Frontend API interface

This are the frontend APIs in JavaScript that are available to a custom node.

## Backend API interface

These are the backend APIs in Python that are available to a custom node.
