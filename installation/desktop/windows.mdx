**ComfyUI Desktop** is a standalone installation version that can be installed like regular software. It supports quick installation and automatic configuration of the **Python environment and dependencies**, and supports one-click import of existing ComfyUI settings, models, workflows, and files. You can quickly migrate from an existing [ComfyUI Portable version](/installation/comfyui_portable_windows) to the Desktop version

ComfyUI Desktop is an open source project, please visit the full code [here](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop)

ComfyUI Desktop hardware requirements:

  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - GPU Selection](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-2.jpg)

   The three options are:
   1. **Nvidia GPU (Recommended):** Direct support for pytorch and CUDA
   2. **Manual Configuration:** You need to manually install and configure the python runtime environment. Don't select this unless you know how to configure
   3. **Enable CPU Mode:** For developers and special cases only. Don't select this unless you're sure you need it
    
    Unless there are special circumstances, please select **NVIDIA** as shown and click **Next** to proceed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install location">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Installation Location](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-3.jpg)

   In this step, you will select the installation location for the following ComfyUI content:
  - **Python Environment**
  - **Models Model Files**
  - **Custom Nodes Custom Nodes**

  Recommendations:
  - Please select a **solid-state drive** as the installation location, which will increase ComfyUI's performance when accessing models.
  - Please create a separate empty folder as the ComfyUI installation directory
  - Please ensure that the corresponding disk has at least around **15G** of disk space to ensure the installation of ComfyUI Desktop
  
  <Note>Not all files are installed in this directory, some files will still be installed on the C drive, and if you need to uninstall in the future, you can refer to the uninstallation section of this guide to complete the full uninstallation of ComfyUI Desktop</Note>

  After completing this step, click **Next** to proceed to the next step

  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate from Existing Installation (Optional)">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - File Migration](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-4.jpg)

  In this step you can migrate your existing ComfyUI installation content to ComfyUI Desktop. As shown, I selected my original **D:\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI** installation directory. The installer will automatically recognize:
  - **User Files**
  - **Models:** Will not be copied, only linked with desktop version
  - **Custom Nodes:** Nodes will be reinstalled

  Don't worry, this step won't copy model files. You can check or uncheck options as needed. Click **Next** to continue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Desktop Settings">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Desktop Settings](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-5.jpg)

   These are preference settings:
   1. **Automatic Updates:** Whether to set automatic updates when ComfyUI updates are available
   2. **Usage Metrics:** If enabled, we will collect **anonymous usage data** to help improve ComfyUI
   3. **Mirror Settings:** Since the program needs internet access to download Python and complete environment installation, if you see a red ‚ùå during installation indicating this may cause installation failure, please follow the steps below

   ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Mirror Settings](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-6.jpg)
   Expand the mirror settings to find the specific failing mirror. In this screenshot the error is **Python Install Mirror** failure.

   You can use either of these methods to resolve mirror link errors:
   1. Find available mirror sources and update mirrors
   2. Make sure [Python 3.12 +](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above is installed

  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete the installation">
  If everything is correct, the installer will complete and automatically enter the ComfyUI Desktop interface, then the installation is successful

## Troubleshooting

### Display unsupported devices

![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Unsupported Device](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-0.jpg)

Since ComfyUI Desktop (Windows) only supports **NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA**, you may see this screen if your device is not supported
- Please switch to a supported device
