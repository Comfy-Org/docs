## Additional ComfyUI Portable Instructions

### 1. Upgrading ComfyUI Portable

You can use the batch commands in the update folder to upgrade your ComfyUI Portable version

```
ComfyUI_windows_portable
└─ 📂update
   ├── update.py
   ├── update_comfyui.bat                          // Update ComfyUI to the latest commit version
   ├── update_comfyui_and_python_dependencies.bat  // Only use when you have issues with your runtime environment
   └── update_comfyui_stable.bat                   // Update ComfyUI to the latest stable version
```

### 2. Setting Up LAN Access for ComfyUI Portable

If your ComfyUI is running on a local network and you want other devices to access ComfyUI, you can modify the `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` or `run_cpu.bat` file using Notepad to complete the configuration. This is mainly done by adding `--listen` to specify the listening address.
Below is an example of the `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` file command with the `--listen` parameter added

```bat
.\python_embeded\python.exe -s ComfyUI\main.py --listen --windows-standalone-build
pause
```

After enabling ComfyUI, you will notice the final running address will become
```
Starting server

To see the GUI go to: http://0.0.0.0:8188
To see the GUI go to: http://[::]:8188
```

You can press `WIN + R` and type `cmd` to open the command prompt, then enter `ipconfig` to view your local IP address. Other devices can then access ComfyUI by entering `http://your-local-IP:8188` in their browser.
