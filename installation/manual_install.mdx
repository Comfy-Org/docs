For the installation of ComfyUI, it is mainly divided into several steps:
1. Create a virtual environment(avoid polluting the system-level Python environment)
2. Clone the ComfyUI code repository
3. Install dependencies
4. Start ComfyUI

You can also refer to [ComfyUI CLI](comfy-cli/getting-started) to install ComfyUI, it is a command line tool that can easily install ComfyUI and manage its dependencies.

## Create a virtual environment

<Tip>
    Independent virtual environments are necessary because ComfyUI's dependencies may conflict with other dependencies on the system, and it can also avoid polluting the system-level Python environment.
</Tip>
