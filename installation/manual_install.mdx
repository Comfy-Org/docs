For the installation of ComfyUI, it is mainly divided into several steps:
1. Create a virtual environment(avoid polluting the system-level Python environment)
2. Clone the ComfyUI code repository
3. Install dependencies
4. Start ComfyUI

<Note>
Python 3.13 is very well supported. If you have trouble with some custom node dependencies on 3.13 you can try 3.12.

Python 3.14 will work if you comment out the `kornia` dependency in the requirements.txt file (breaks the canny node) but it is not recommended.
</Note>

You can also refer to [ComfyUI CLI](/comfy-cli/getting-started) to install ComfyUI, it is a command line tool that can easily install ComfyUI and manage its dependencies.

## Create a virtual environment

<Tip>
    Independent virtual environments are necessary because ComfyUI's dependencies may conflict with other dependencies on the system, and it can also avoid polluting the system-level Python environment.
</Tip>

## Clone the ComfyUI code repository

You need to ensure that you have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your system. First, you need to open the terminal (command line), then clone the code repository.

## How to update ComfyUI

<Steps>
    <Step title="pull the latest code">
    Use the command line to enter the installation path of ComfyUI, then pull the latest code.
    ```bash
    cd <installation path>/ComfyUI
    git pull
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="install the dependencies">
    Use the command line to enter the installation path of ComfyUI, then install the dependencies.
    <Warning>
    You need to ensure that the current Python environment is the ComfyUI virtual environment, otherwise the dependencies will be installed to the system-level Python environment, polluting the system-level Python environment.
    </Warning>
    ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
