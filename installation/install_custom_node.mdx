## What are Custom Nodes ?

Custom nodes are extensions for ComfyUI that add new functionality like advanced image processing, machine learning fine-tuning, color adjustments, and more. These community-developed nodes can significantly expand ComfyUI's core capabilities.

<Warning>
Before installing custom nodes, it's important to review them carefully. Since ComfyUI is an open-source project, malicious plugins could potentially exploit custom nodes:
1. Only install custom nodes from trusted authors and those commonly used by the community
2. Understand the plugin's functionality before installing and avoid unknown sources to ensure system security
3. Avoid installing obscure or suspicious plugins - unverified plugins may pose security risks that could lead to system compromise
</Warning>

All custom node installations require completing these two steps:

1. Clone the node code to the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory
2. Install the required Python dependencies

This guide covers three installation methods. Here's a comparison of their pros and cons. While [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager) isn't yet part of the core dependencies, it will be in the future. We still provide other installation guides to meet different needs.

| Method                        | Advantages                                                    | Disadvantages                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ComfyUI Manager** (Recommended) | 1. Automated installation<br/>2. Dependency handling<br/>3. GUI interface | Cannot directly search for nodes not registered in the registry |
| **Git Clone**                | Can install nodes not registered in the registry               | 1. Requires Git knowledge<br/>2. Manual dependency handling<br/>3. Installation risks |
| **Repository ZIP Download**   | 1. No Git required<br/>2. Manual control                      | 1. Manual dependency handling<br/>2. No version control<br/>3. Installation risks |

Tip: Before installing custom nodes, check the plugin's README file to understand installation methods, usage, and requirements like specific models, dependency versions, and common issue solutions.

## Method 1: ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Click the `Manager` button in ComfyUI interface">
     ![Click ComfyUI Manager](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-manager-1.jpg)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Select `Install Custom Nodes`">
      ![Select Install Custom Nodes](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-manager-2.jpg)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Browse the custom nodes list">
      <Warning>
      Custom nodes listed in ComfyUI Manager aren't necessarily safe. Understand their functionality before installing and ensure you only install trusted plugins and those from popular authors to avoid potential device risks.
      </Warning>

      ![Enter node name in search box](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-manager-3.jpg)
      ![Enter node name in search box](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-manager-4.jpg)
      1. Nodes marked with `⚠️` may have dependency conflicts with other plugins
      2. Author names marked with `✅` indicate their activity level on Github
      3. Potential plugin risks are highlighted in red - ensure plugin safety before installing
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click the `Install` button for the desired node">
      ![Click Install button for the node](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-manager-5.jpg)
      Find the node you want to install and click the `Install` button
      ![Click Install button for the node](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-manager-6.jpg)
      - 在这一步，如果你选择 `nightly` 版本，这会从 Github 直接下载对应的插件源码最新版本，但同时如果你的 Manager `security_level` 为 `normal` 将不允许你直接从 Github 下载源码，因为对应代码没有经过扫描
      - 如果你选择了其它版本如 `latest` 或者带有数字的稳定版本，对应的代码将会从 https://registry.comfy.org/ 进行下载，这意味着对应的代码经过审查，不会触发安全检查
      <Tip>
        `nightly` 版本通常是最新的版本，但因为它直接从 github 下载没有经过审查的版本，存在一定的代码风险，如果你一定需要安装`nightly`版本，请将 Manager 的 `security_level` 设置为 `weak`
        对应配置文件路径为 `ComfyUI/user/default/ComfyUI-Manager/config.ini`,但请注意这并不是我们推荐的配置，请只临时使用这个配置
      </Tip>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Wait for dependencies to install and restart ComfyUI">
      Manager will automatically install dependencies and prompt you to restart ComfyUI when complete
      ![Restart ComfyUI and refresh browser after installation](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-manager-7.jpg)
      ![Restart ComfyUI and refresh browser after installation](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-manager-8.jpg)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify successful installation">
    Check ComfyUI Manager after restart to confirm the plugin installed successfully and there are no `import failed` errors

    </Step>
  </Steps>

## Method 2: Manual Installation Using Git

Suitable for new nodes not found in Manager or when specific versions are needed. Requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your system.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the repository URL">
    Click the "Code" button on GitHub and copy the HTTPS link
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to custom_nodes directory">
 ```bash
 cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
 ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
 ```bash
 git clone [repository URL]
 ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
  Dependencies must be installed in your ComfyUI environment - be careful not to mix with your system environment to avoid contamination
   <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Windows Portable">
    For Windows portable version, install dependencies in the embedded Python environment
      ```bash
      python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI\custom_nodes\[node directory]\requirements.txt
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Manual Install">
    Install dependencies in your ComfyUI environment
      ```bash
      cd [node directory]
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart ComfyUI and refresh browser">
    Restart ComfyUI and refresh your browser. Check startup logs for any `import failed` errors
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Method 3: ZIP Download Installation
Suitable for users who cannot use Git or Manager

<Warning>
We don't recommend this installation method as it loses version control capabilities
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click `Code` → `Download ZIP` on GitHub">
    Click `Code` → `Download ZIP` on the GitHub page
    ![Click Code → Download ZIP on GitHub](/images/installation/custom_nodes/install-custom-nodes-by-zip.jpg)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract the ZIP file">
    Extract the downloaded ZIP file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy extracted folder to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory">
    Copy the extracted folder to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies manually (same as Git method step 4)">
    Restart ComfyUI and refresh browser
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify successful installation">
    Check ComfyUI Manager after restart to confirm the plugin installed successfully and there are no `import failed` errors
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom Node Resources

Currently, in addition to the basic node extension features, custom nodes also include:
- [Node Documentation](/custom-nodes/help_page): Guides for using nodes
- [Custom Node Workflow Templates](/custom-nodes/workflow_templates): Workflow templates provided by node authors, which can be browsed and loaded in ComfyUI templates
