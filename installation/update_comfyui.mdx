## ComfyUI Version Types

Depending on your installation method, ComfyUI offers several installation versions. The links below contain update instructions for each version.

<InstallLink/>

## What Needs to Be Updated When Updating ComfyUI?

ComfyUI updates primarily consist of two components:
1. Update ComfyUI's core code
2. Update ComfyUI's core dependencies, including necessary Python dependencies and ComfyUI functional dependency packages

**Core Code**: New nodes, new model support, new features, etc.
**Core Dependencies**: Mainly includes ComfyUI's frontend functionality, workflow templates, node help documentation, etc.

```
comfyui-frontend-package   # ComfyUI frontend functionality
comfyui-workflow-templates # ComfyUI workflow templates  
comfyui-embedded-docs      # ComfyUI node help documentation
```

These three core dependencies are maintained in separate repositories:
- [ComfyUI_frontend](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI_frontend/) - Frontend interface and interactive features
- [workflow_templates](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/workflow_templates) - Pre-built workflow templates
- [comfyui-embedded-docs](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/embedded-docs) - Node help documentation

It's important to understand the difference between development (nightly) and stable (release) versions:
- **Development version (nightly)**: Latest commit code, giving you access to the newest features, but may contain potential issues
- **Stable version (release)**: Built on stable releases, usually lags behind development versions but offers higher stability. We support stable versions after features are tested and stabilized

Many users often find themselves on release versions or desktop versions during updates, but discover that needed features are only available in development versions. In such cases, check if your local `ComfyUI/requirements.txt` matches the [nightly version dependencies](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/requirements.txt) to determine if all dependencies support the latest features.

## Common Update Issues

### Missing or Outdated Frontend, Workflow Templates, Node  After Updates


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dependencies Not Properly Updated">
    Users often only use the `git pull` command to update ComfyUI code but **neglect core dependency updates**, leading to the following issues:

  - Missing or abnormal frontend functionality
  - Cannot find newly added workflow templates
  - Outdated or missing node help documentation
  - New features lack corresponding frontend support

  After using the `git pull` command, use the corresponding ComfyUI environment to use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to update dependencies.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Dependency Update Failures">
    If dependency updates fail, it's commonly due to network or computer permission issues. When core dependency failures occur during updates, the system falls back to older versions. You'll typically see logs like this during startup:
    ```
    Falling back to the default frontend.
    ComfyUI frontend version: xxx
    ```

    Follow these troubleshooting steps:
    1. Use `pip list` in the appropriate environment to view currently installed dependency packages. If you find version inconsistencies, use `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the ComfyUI environment to attempt dependency updates again.
    2. If issues persist after updating, check your network connection. Users in mainland China may need to configure a proxy to reliably access GitHub repositories.
    3. If problems continue, check computer permissions. If administrator privileges are required, run the command line with administrator rights.
  </Tab>

### How to Properly Update Core Dependencies

### Core Dependency Update Troubleshooting

If core dependency updates fail, follow these troubleshooting steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Network Connection">
    If located in mainland China, ensure you can access PyPI or configure a domestic mirror:
    ```bash
    # Using Tsinghua University mirror
    pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Core Packages Individually">
    If batch installation fails, try installing packages individually. **First check version requirements in `ComfyUI/requirements.txt`**:
    
    **Then install according to specified versions:**
    ```bash
    pip install comfyui-frontend-package==1.17.11 
    pip install comfyui-workflow-templates==1.0.0
    pip install comfyui-embedded-docs==1.0.0
    ```
    <Warning>
    It's recommended to use the exact version numbers specified in `ComfyUI/requirements.txt`. Don't upgrade to the latest versions independently, as this may cause compatibility issues.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why Can't I Find New Features After Updating?

This is one of the most common issues:
- If you're using the **Desktop version**, features may lag behind because the desktop version is built on stable releases
- Ensure you're using the **development version (nightly)**, not the **stable version (release)**

Additionally, ensure that corresponding dependencies have been successfully updated during the update process. If issues persist after updating, refer to the [Dependency Update Troubleshooting](#dependency-update-troubleshooting) section to diagnose problems.

### How to Switch Between Development (Nightly) and Stable (Release) Versions?

Differences between versions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Development Version (Nightly)">
    - **Characteristics**: Contains the latest commit code
    - **Advantages**: Experience the latest features and improvements first
    - **Risks**: May contain undiscovered bugs or unstable factors
    - **Suitable for**: Developers, testers, users wanting to experience the latest features
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stable Version (Release)">
    - **Characteristics**: Tested and verified stable code
    - **Advantages**: High stability, suitable for production environments
    - **Disadvantages**: Feature updates have delays, may lag behind development versions by weeks or months
    - **Suitable for**: Users requiring stability, production environment users
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Portable">
    Use `update_comfyui.bat` instead of `update_comfyui_stable.bat`:
    ```
    # Development version (latest features)
    double-click: update_comfyui.bat
    
    # Stable version
    double-click: update_comfyui_stable.bat
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Installation">
    ```bash
    # Switch to development version
    git checkout master
    git pull
    
    # Switch to latest stable version
    git fetch --tags
    git checkout $(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Desktop">
    Desktop version is typically built on stable releases and doesn't currently support version switching. If you need the latest features, we recommend:
    1. Wait for desktop version updates
    2. Or use portable/manual installation to experience the latest features
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### What to Do When Errors Occur After Updates?

1. **Check Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure all dependencies are updated
2. **Check Custom Nodes**: Some custom nodes may be incompatible with new versions
3. **Roll Back Version**: If issues are severe, you can roll back to a previous stable version

If problems occur, refer to our troubleshooting page for solutions.
