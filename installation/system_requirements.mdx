In this guide, we will introduce the system requirements for installing ComfyUI. Due to frequent updates of ComfyUI, this document may not be updated in a timely manner. Please refer to the relevant instructions in [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

Regardless of which version of ComfyUI you use, it runs in a separate Python environment.

### System Requirements

Currently, we support the following operating systems:
- Windows
- Linux
- macOS (supports Apple Silicon, such as the M series)

You can refer to the following sections to learn about the installation methods for different systems and versions of ComfyUI. In the installation of different versions, we have simply described the system requirements.

### Python Version

- **Python 3.13** is very well supported and recommended
- Python 3.14 works but you may encounter issues with the torch compile node
- Python 3.12 is a good fallback if you have trouble with some custom node dependencies on 3.13

### Browser Requirements

For the best experience, use **Google Chrome version 143 or later**. Earlier versions of Chrome (142 and below) have known issues that can cause visual glitches and performance problems in ComfyUI.

### Supported Hardware

- NVIDIA GPU
- AMD GPU
- Intel GPU (includes Arc series, supports IPEX)
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2)
- Ascend NPU
- Cambricon MLU
- CPU (can use the --cpu parameter, slower)

Please refer to the [ComfyUI Windows and Linux manual installation section](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI?tab=readme-ov-file#manual-install-windows-linux) for detailed installation steps.

<Note>
The stable version of PyTorch 2.7 now supports the Blackwell architecture (CUDA 12.8), and the core and desktop versions of ComfyUI have adopted this version.
</Note>

### Dependencies

- Install PyTorch
- Install all dependencies in the requirements.txt of ComfyUI
