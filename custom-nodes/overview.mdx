Custom nodes allow you to implement new features and share them with the wider community. 

A custom node is like any Comfy node: it takes input, does something to it, and produces an output. 
While some custom nodes perform highly complex tasks, many just do one thing. Here's an example of a 
simple node that takes an image and inverts it.

## Client-Server Model

Comfy runs in a client-server model. The server, written in Python, handles all the real work: data-processing, models, image diffusion etc. The client, written in Javascript, handles the user interface. 

Comfy can also be used in API mode, in which a workflow is sent to the server by a non-Comfy client (such as another UI, or a command line script).

Custom nodes can be placed into one of four categories:

### Server side only

The majority of Custom Nodes run purely on the server side, by defining a Python class that specifies the input and output types, and provides a function that can be called to process inputs and produce an output.

### Client side only

A few Custom Nodes provide a modification to the client UI, but do not add core functionality. Despite the name, they may not even add new nodes to the system.

### Independent Client and Server

Custom nodes may provide additional server features, and additional (related) UI features (such as a new widget to deal with a new data type). In most cases, communication between the client and server can be handled by the Comfy data flow control.

### Connected Client and Server

In a small number of cases, the UI features and the server need to interact with each other directly. 

<Warning>Any node that requires Client-Server communication will not be compatible with use through the API.</Warning>
