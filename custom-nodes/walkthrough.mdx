This page will take you step-by-step through the process of creating a custom node. 

Our example will take a batch of images, and return one of the images. Initially, the node
will return the image which is, on average, the lightest in color; we'll then extend
it to have a range of selection criteria, and then finally add some client side code.

This page assumes very little knowledge of Python or Javascript.

After this walkthrough, dive into the details of [backend code](./backend/server_overview), and 
[frontend code](./backend/server_overview).

## Write a basic node

### Prerequisites

- A working ComfyUI [installation](/installation/manual_install). For development, we recommend installing ComfyUI manually.
- A working comfy-cli [installation](/comfy-cli/getting-started).

### Setting up 

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
comfy node scaffold
```

After answering a few questions, you'll have a new directory set up.

```bash
 ~  % comfy node scaffold

### Defining the node

Add the following code to the end of `src/nodes.py`:

```Python src/nodes.py
class ImageSelector:
    CATEGORY = "example"
    @classmethod    
    def INPUT_TYPES(s):
        return { "required":  { "images": ("IMAGE",), } }
    RETURN_TYPES = ("IMAGE",)
    FUNCTION = "choose_image"
```

<Info>The basic structure of a custom node is described in detail [here](/custom-nodes/backend/server_overview). </Info>

A custom node is defined using a Python class, which must include these four things: `CATEGORY`, 
which specifies where in the add new node menu the custom node will be located, 
`INPUT_TYPES`, which is a class method defining what inputs the node will take
(see [later](/custom-nodes/backend/server_overview#input-types) for details of the dictionary returned),
`RETURN_TYPES`, which defines what outputs the node will produce, and `FUNCTION`, the name
of the function that will be called when the node is executed.

<Tip>Notice that the data type for input and output is `IMAGE` (singular) even though 
we expect to receive a batch of images, and return just one. In Comfy, `IMAGE` means
image batch, and a single image is treated as a batch of size 1.</Tip>

### The main function

The main function, `choose_image`, receives named arguments as defined in `INPUT_TYPES`, and
returns a `tuple` as defined in `RETURN_TYPES`. Since we're dealing with images, which are internally
stored as `torch.Tensor`, 

```Python
import torch
```

Then add the function to your class. The datatype for image is `torch.Tensor` with shape `[B,H,W,C]`,
where `B` is the batch size and `C` is the number of channels - 3, for RGB. If we iterate over such
a tensor, we will get a series of `B` tensors of shape `[H,W,C]`. The `.flatten()` method turns 
this into a one dimensional tensor, of length `H*W*C`, `torch.mean()` takes the mean, and `.item()`
turns a single value tensor into a Python float. 

```Python
def choose_image(self, images):
    brightness = list(torch.mean(image.flatten()).item() for image in images)
    brightest = brightness.index(max(brightness))
    result = images[brightest].unsqueeze(0)
    return (result,)
```

Notes on those last two lines: 

- `images[brightest]` will return a Tensor of shape `[H,W,C]`. `unsqueeze` is used to insert a (length 1) dimension at, in this case, dimension zero, to give 
us `[B,H,W,C]` with `B=1`: a single image.
- in `return (result,)`, the trailing comma is essential to ensure you return a tuple.

### Register the node

To make Comfy recognize the new node, it must be available at the package level. Modify the `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` variable at the end of `src/nodes.py`. You must restart ComfyUI to see any changes.  

```Python src/nodes.py

NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS = {
    "Example" : Example,
    "Image Selector" : ImageSelector,
}

# Optionally, you can rename the node in the `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` dictionary.
NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS = {
    "Example": "Example Node",
    "Image Selector": "Image Selector",
}
```

<Info>For a detailed explanation of how ComfyUI discovers and loads custom nodes, see the [node lifecycle documentation](/custom-nodes/backend/lifecycle).</Info>

## Add some options

That node is maybe a bit boring, so we might add some options; a widget that allows you to 
choose the brightest image, or the reddest, bluest, or greenest. Edit your `INPUT_TYPES` to look like:

```Python
@classmethod    
def INPUT_TYPES(s):
    return { "required":  { "images": ("IMAGE",), 
                            "mode": (["brightest", "reddest", "greenest", "bluest"],)} }
```

Then update the main function. We'll use a fairly naive definition of 'reddest' as being the average
`R` value of the pixels divided by the average of all three colors. So:

```Python
def choose_image(self, images, mode):
    batch_size = images.shape[0]
    brightness = list(torch.mean(image.flatten()).item() for image in images)
    if (mode=="brightest"):
        scores = brightness
    else:
        channel = 0 if mode=="reddest" else (1 if mode=="greenest" else 2)
        absolute = list(torch.mean(image[:,:,channel].flatten()).item() for image in images)
        scores = list( absolute[i]/(brightness[i]+1e-8) for i in range(batch_size) )
    best = scores.index(max(scores))
    result = images[best].unsqueeze(0)
    return (result,)
```

## Tweak the UI

Maybe we'd like a bit of visual feedback, so let's send a little text message to be displayed.

### Send a message from server

This requires two lines to be added to the Python code:

```Python
from server import PromptServer
```

and, at the end of the `choose_image` method, add a line to send a message to the front end (`send_sync` takes a message
type, which should be unique, and a dictionary)

```Python
PromptServer.instance.send_sync("example.imageselector.textmessage", {"message":f"Picked image {best+1}"})
return (result,)
```

### Write a client extension

To add some Javascript to the client, create a subdirectory, `web/js` in your custom node directory, and modify the end of `__init__.py` 
to tell Comfy about it by exporting `WEB_DIRECTORY`:

```Python
WEB_DIRECTORY = "./web/js"
__all__ = ['NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS', 'WEB_DIRECTORY']
```

The client extension is saved as a `.js` file in the `web/js` subdirectory, so create `image_selector/web/js/imageSelector.js` with the 
code below. (For more, see [client side coding](./js/javascript_overview)).

```Javascript
app.registerExtension({
	name: "example.imageselector",
    async setup() {
        function messageHandler(event) { alert(event.detail.message); }
        app.api.addEventListener("example.imageselector.textmessage", messageHandler);
    },
})
```

All we've done is register an extension and add a listener for the message type we are sending in the `setup()` method. This reads the dictionary we sent (which is stored in `event.detail`).

Stop the Comfy server, start it again, reload the webpage, and run your workflow.
