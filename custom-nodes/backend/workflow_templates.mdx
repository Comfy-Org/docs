title: "Workflow templates"

If you have example workflow files associated with your custom nodes 
then ComfyUI can show these to the user in the template browser (`Workflow`/`Browse Templates` menu). 
Workflow templates are a great way to support people getting started with your nodes.

All you have to do as a node developer is to create an `example_workflows` folder and place the `json` files there. 
Optionally you can place `jpg` files with the same name to be shown as the template thumbnail.  

Under the hood ComfyUI statically serves these files along with an endpoint (`/api/workflow_templates`) 
that returns the collection of workflow templates.

## Example

Under `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule/example_workflows/` directory:
 - `My_example_workflow_1.json`
 - `My_example_workflow_1.jpg`
 - `My_example_workflow_2.json`

In this example ComfyUI's template browser shows a category called `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule` with two items, one of which has a thumbnail.
