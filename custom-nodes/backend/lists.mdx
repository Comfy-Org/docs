## Length one processing

Internally, the Comfy server represents data flowing from one node to the next as a Python `list`, normally length 1, of the relevant datatype.
In normal operation, when a node returns an output, each element in the output `tuple` is separately wrapped in a list (length 1); then when the 
next node is called, the data is unwrapped and passed to the main function.

<Tip>You generally don't need to worry about this, since Comfy does the wrapping and unwrapping.</Tip>

<Tip>This isn't about batches. A batch (of, for instance, latents, or images) is a *single entry* in the list (see [tensor datatypes](./custom_node_images_and_masks))</Tip>

## List processing

In some circumstance, multiple data instances are processed in a single workflow, in which case the internal data will be a list containing the data instances.
An example of this might be processing a series of images one at a time to avoid running out of VRAM, or handling images of different sizes.

By default, Comfy will process the values in the list sequentially: 
- if the inputs are `list`s of different lengths, the shorter ones are padded by repeating the last value
- the main method is called once for each value in the input lists
- the outputs are `list`s, each of which is the same length as the longest input

The relevant code can be found in the method `map_node_over_list` in `execution.py`.

However, as Comfy wraps node outputs into a `list` of length one, if the `tuple` returned by
a custom node contains a `list`, that `list` will be wrapped, and treated as a single piece of data.
In order to tell Comfy that the list being returned should not be wrapped, but treated as a series of data for sequential processing, 
the node should provide a class attribute `OUTPUT_IS_LIST`, which is a `tuple[bool]`, of the same length as `RETURN_TYPES`, specifying 
which outputs which should be so treated.

A node can also override the default input behaviour and receive the whole list in a single call. This is done by setting a class attribute
`INPUT_IS_LIST` to `True`.

Here's a (lightly annotated) example from the built in nodes - `ImageRebatch` takes one or more batches of images (received as a list, because `INPUT_IS_LIST - True`)
and rebatches them into batches of the requested size.

<Tip>`INPUT_IS_LIST` is node level - all inputs get the same treatment. So the value of the `batch_size` widget is given by `batch_size[0]`.</Tip>

```Python

class ImageRebatch:
    @classmethod
    def INPUT_TYPES(s):
        return {"required": { "images": ("IMAGE",),
                              "batch_size": ("INT", {"default": 1, "min": 1, "max": 4096}) }}
    RETURN_TYPES = ("IMAGE",)
    INPUT_IS_LIST = True
    OUTPUT_IS_LIST = (True, )
    FUNCTION = "rebatch"
    CATEGORY = "image/batch"

    def rebatch(self, images, batch_size):
        batch_size = batch_size[0]    # everything comes as a list, so batch_size is list[int]

        output_list = []
        all_images = []
        for img in images:                    # each img is a batch of images
            for i in range(img.shape[0]):     # each i is a single image
                all_images.append(img[i:i+1])

        for i in range(0, len(all_images), batch_size): # take batch_size chunks and turn each into a new batch
            output_list.append(torch.cat(all_images[i:i+batch_size], dim=0))  # will die horribly if the image batches had different width or height!

        return (output_list,)
```
