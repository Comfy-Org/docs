title: "Subgraph blueprints"
---

If you have reusable subgraph components associated with your custom nodes, ComfyUI can make these available to users as global subgraph blueprints. Subgraph blueprints allow users to quickly add pre-built node groups from the subgraph menu.

All you have to do as a node developer is create a `subgraphs` folder in your custom node directory and place the `.json` files there.

Under the hood, ComfyUI scans all custom node directories for subgraph files and serves them via the `/global_subgraphs` API endpoint.

## Example

Under `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule/subgraphs/` directory:
 - `My_upscale_subgraph.json`
 - `My_effects_subgraph.json`

In this example, ComfyUI's subgraph browser shows blueprints from `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule` that users can add to their workflows.

## Creating a subgraph JSON file

Subgraph JSON files use the same format as workflow JSON files. The easiest way to create one:

1. Build your subgraph in ComfyUI
2. Select the nodes you want to include
3. Convert them to a subgraph
4. Export the subgraph as JSON
5. Place the JSON file in your `subgraphs/` folder
