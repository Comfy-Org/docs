title: "Workflow templates"
---

If you have example workflow files associated with your custom nodes 
then ComfyUI can show these to the user in the template browser (`Workflow`/`Browse Templates` menu). 
Workflow templates are a great way to support people getting started with your nodes.

All you have to do as a node developer is to create an `example_workflows` folder and place the `json` files there. 
Optionally you can place `jpg` files with the same name to be shown as the template thumbnail.  

Under the hood ComfyUI statically serves these files along with an endpoint (`/api/workflow_templates`) 
that returns the collection of workflow templates.

<Note>

The following folder names are also accepted, but we still recommend using `example_workflows`
- workflow
- workflows
- example
- examples
</Note>

## Example

Under `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule/example_workflows/` directory:
 - `My_example_workflow_1.json`
 - `My_example_workflow_1.jpg`
 - `My_example_workflow_2.json`

In this example ComfyUI's template browser shows a category called `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule` with two items, one of which has a thumbnail.

For a real-world example, see [ComfyUI-Impact-Pack's example_workflows folder](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack/tree/Main/example_workflows).

## Customization
More extensive configuration can be done by adding an `index.json` to the example workflow folder.
This index should follow the core workflows standard and optionaly contain:
* `description` the custom node description
* `templates` A list of The customized templates

Each template can contain the following keys:
* `name`: needs to match the template file name. Mandatory
* `title`: The template title. Optional, default to workflow name
* `description`: The title description. Optional, default to workflow name
* `mediaSubtype`: the workflow thumbnail file(s) extenstion (`jpg`, `png`, `webp`, ...), default to `jpg`. Optional.
* `thumbnailVariant`: custom thumbnail variant, either `compareSlider` or `hoverDissolve` for now. Requires a `mediaSubtype` to be set and the thumbnails files suffixed with `-1` and `-2`. Optional

### Example
This example `index.json`
```json
{
  "description": "An awesome CustomNode module.",
  "templates": [
    {
      "name": "My_example_workflow_1",
      "title": "My First Workflow",
      "description": "A workflow generating an awesome Image.",
    },
    {
      "name": "My_example_workflow_2",
      "title": "My Second Workflow",
      "description": "A workflow upscaling an image with more details.",
      "mediaSubtype": "webp",
      "thumbnailVariant": "compareSlider"
    }
  ]
}
```

Will work with the following structure under `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule/example_workflows/` directory:
 - `index.json`
 - `My_example_workflow_1.json`
 - `My_example_workflow_1.jpg`
 - `My_example_workflow_2.json`
 - `My_example_workflow_2-1.webp`
 - `My_example_workflow_2-2.webp`
