title: "Workflow templates"
---

If you have example workflow files associated with your custom nodes 
then ComfyUI can show these to the user in the template browser (`Workflow`/`Browse Templates` menu). 
Workflow templates are a great way to support people getting started with your nodes.

All you have to do as a node developer is to create an `example_workflows` folder and place the `json` files there. 
Optionally you can place `jpg` files with the same name to be shown as the template thumbnail.  

Under the hood ComfyUI statically serves these files along with an endpoint (`/api/workflow_templates`) 
that returns the collection of workflow templates.

<Note>

The following folder names are also accepted, but we still recommend using `example_workflows`
- workflow
- workflows
- example
- examples
</Note>

## Example

Under `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule/example_workflows/` directory:
 - `My_example_workflow_1.json`
 - `My_example_workflow_1.jpg`
 - `My_example_workflow_2.json`

In this example ComfyUI's template browser shows a category called `ComfyUI-MyCustomNodeModule` with two items, one of which has a thumbnail.


<Tip>
    Currently, only JSON format workflow files are supported for custom node templates. If you use ComfyUI to generate images in the corresponding folder, users cannot directly access the corresponding workflow in the template browser.

## Best practices

### Workflow naming

Use descriptive file names to help users understand the purpose of the workflow:

**Good naming examples:**
- `basic_image_enhancement.json` - Basic image enhancement
- `advanced_portrait_processing.json` - Advanced portrait processing
- `batch_upscaling_workflow.json` - Batch upscaling workflow

**Avoid naming:**
- `workflow1.json`
- `test.json`
- `untitled.json`

### Thumbnail creation

Create meaningful thumbnail images:

1. **Size suggestion**: Due to the limited size of thumbnails in the frontend, we currently use a size of 400x400 in the native template creation process, but other sizes will also be supported.
2. **Format**: We recommend using the webp format, which is smaller in file size and can also play webp video files directly.
3. **Content**: Display the typical output results of the workflow.
4. **Quality**: Use high-quality example images.

### Workflow validation

Ensure the quality of the workflow template:

1. **Test completeness**: Ensure that the workflow can be successfully executed.
2. **Dependency check**: Verify that all required models and nodes are available.
3. **Parameter reasonableness**: Use reasonable default parameter values.
4. **Output quality**: Ensure that the example output is representative and of high quality.
