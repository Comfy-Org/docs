## Using Models in ComfyUI
To use models in your workflow:
1. Place them in the appropriate `models` folders within your ComfyUI installation
2. Load them using the corresponding nodes (Load Checkpoint, Load LoRA, Load VAE)
3. Connect them to other nodes in your workflow to influence the generation process

Models can be combined and mixed to achieve different effects, making them essential building blocks for creating custom image generation workflows.
