## How Comfy loads custom nodes

When Comfy starts, it scans the directory `custom_nodes` for Python modules, and attempts to load them. 
If the module exports `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`, it will be treated as a custom node.
<Tip>A python module is a directory containing an `__init__.py` file. 
The module exports whatever is listed in the `__all__` attribute defined in `__init__.py`.</Tip>

### __init__.py

`__init__.py` is executed when Comfy attempts to import the module. For a module to be recognized as containing
custom node definitions, it needs to export `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`. If it does (and if nothing goes wrong in the import),
the nodes defined in the module will be available in Comfy. If there is an error in your code, 
Comfy will continue, but will report the module as having failed to load. So check the Python console!

A very simple `__init__.py` file would look like this:
```python
from .python_file import MyCustomNode
NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS = { "My Custom Node" : MyCustomNode }
__all__ = ["NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS"]
```

#### NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS

`NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` must be a `dict` mapping custom node names (unique across the Comfy install) 
to the corresponding node class. 

#### NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS

`__init__.py` may also export `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS`, which maps the same unique name to a display name for the node.
If `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS` is not provided, Comfy will use the unique name as the display name.

#### WEB_DIRECTORY

If you are deploying client side code, you will also need to export the path, relative to the module, in which the 
JavaScript files are to be found. It is conventional to place these in a subdirectory of your custom node named `js`.
<Tip>*Only* `.js` files will be served; you can't deploy `.css` or other types in this way</Tip>

<Warning>In previous versions of Comfy, `__init__.py` was required to copy the JavaScript files into the main Comfy web
subdirectory. You will still see code that does this. Don't.</Warning>

## ComfyUI Manager

While custom nodes can be installed manually, most people use
[ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) to install them. **ComfyUI Manager** takes care of installing, 
updating, and removing custom nodes, and any dependencies. But it isn't part
of the Comfy core, so you need to manually install it. 

### Installing ComfyUI Manager

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git
```

Restart Comfy afterwards. 
See [ComfyUI Manager Install](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for details or special cases.

### Using ComfyUI Manager

To make your custom node available through **ComfyUI Manager** you need to save it as a git repository (generally at `github.com`)
and then submit a Pull Request on the **ComfyUI Manager** git, in which you have edited `custom-node-list.json` to add your node.
[More details](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-register-your-custom-node-into-comfyui-manager).

When a user installs the node, **ComfyUI Manager** will:

<Steps>
<Step title="Git Clone">
git clone the repository, 
</Step>
<Step title="Install Python Dependencies">
install the pip dependencies listed in the custom node repository under `requirements.txt` (if present), 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<Tip>As is always the case with `pip`, it is possible that your node requirements will be in conflict with other
custom nodes. Don't make your `requirements.txt` any more restrictive than they need to be.</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Run Install Script">
execute `install.py`, if it is present in the custom node repository.
<Tip>`install.py` is executed from the root path of the custom node</Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

### ComfyUI Manager files

As indicated above, there are a number of files and scripts that **ComfyUI Manager** will use to manage the lifecycle of 
a custom node. These are all optional.

- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies as mentioned above
- `install.py`, `uninstall.py` - executed when the custom node is installed or uninstalled
<Tip>Users can just delete the directory, so you can't rely on `uninstall.py` being run</Tip>
- `disable.py`, `enable.py` - executed when a custom node is disabled or re-enabled 
<Tip>`enable.py` is only run when a disabled node is re-enabled - it should just reverse anything done in `disable.py`</Tip>
<Tip>Disabled custom node subdirectory have `.disabled` appended to their names, and Comfy ignores these modules</Tip>
- `node_list.json` - only required if the custom nodes pattern of NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS is not conventional.

See the [ComfyUI Manager guide](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-node-support-guide) for official details.
