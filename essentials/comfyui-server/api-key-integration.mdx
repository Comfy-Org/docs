sidebarTitle: 'API Key Integration'
---

Starting from [PR #8041](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/pull/8041), ComfyUI supports directly using built-in API nodes through API Keys, without requiring a specific frontend interface (you can even run completely without a frontend).

This means you can create workflows that combine:
- local OS models
- tools from the custom node community
- popular paid models

run everything together via the local Comfy webserver API, letting it handle all the orchestration.

This is helpful for users who want to use Comfy as a backend service, run Comfy via command line, have their own frontend, etc.

## Prerequisites

Using API Key to call ComfyUI's built-in API nodes requires:
- API Key for the corresponding account
- Sufficient account credits

To use API Key to call ComfyUI's built-in API nodes, you need to first register an account on [ComfyUI Platform](https://platform.comfy.org/login) and create an API key

<Card title="Login with API Key" icon="link" href="/interface/user#logging-in-with-an-api-key">
Please refer to the User Interface section to learn how to login with API Key
</Card>

You need to ensure your ComfyUI account has sufficient credits to test the corresponding features.

## Python Example

Here is an example of how to send a workflow containing API nodes to the ComfyUI API using Python code:

```python
"""Using API nodes when running ComfyUI headless or with alternative frontend

You can execute a ComfyUI workflow that contains API nodes by including an API key in the prompt.
The API key should be added to the `extra_data` field of the payload.
Below we show an example of how to do this.
