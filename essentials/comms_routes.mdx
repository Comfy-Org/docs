## Routes

The server defines a series of `get` and `post` methods 
which can be found by searching for `@routes` in `server.py`. When you submit a workflow
in the web client, it is posted to `/prompt` which validates the prompt and adds it to an execution queue,
returning either a `prompt_id` and `number` (the position in the queue), or `error` and `node_errors` if validation fails.
The prompt queue is defined in `execution.py`, which also defines the `PromptExecutor` class. 

### Built in routes

`server.py` defines the following routes:

|path|get/post|purpose|
|-|-|-|
|`/`|get|load the comfy webpage|
|`/embeddings`|get|retrieve a list of the names of embeddings available|
|`/extensions`|get|retrieve a list of the extensions registering a `WEB_DIRECTORY`|
|`/upload/image`|post|upload an image|
|`/upload/mask`|post|upload a mask|
|`/view`|get|view an image. Lots of options, see `@routes.get("/view")` in `server.py`|
|`/view_metadata`/{folder_name}|get|retrieve metadata for a model|
|`/system_stats`|get|retrieve information about the system (python version, devices, vram etc)|
|`/prompt`|get|retrieve current status|
|`/prompt`|post|submit a prompt to the queue|
|`/object_info`|get|retrieve details of all node types|
|`/object_info/{node_class}`|get|retrieve details of one node type|
|`/history`|get|retrieve the queue history|
|`/history/{prompt_id}`|get|retrieve the queue history for a specific prompt|
|`/history`|post|clear history or delete history item|
|`/queue`|get|retrieve the state of the queue|
|`/interrupt`|post|stop the current workflow|
|`/free`|post|free memory by unloading specified models|

### Custom routes

If you want to send a message from the client to the server during execution, you will need to add a custom route to the server.
For anything complicated, you will need to dive into the [aiohttp framework docs](https://docs.aiohttp.org/), but most cases can 
be handled as follows:

```Python
from server import PromptServer
from aiohttp import web
routes = PromptServer.instance.routes
@routes.post('/my_new_path')
async def my_function(request):
    the_data = await request.post()
    # the_data now holds a dictionary of the values sent
    MyClass.handle_my_message(the_data)
    return web.json_response({})
```

<Tip>Unless you know what you are doing, don't try to define `my_function` within a class. 
The `@routes.post` decorator does a lot of work! Instead, define the function as above
and then call a classmethod.</Tip>

<Tip>You can also define a `@routes.get` if you aren't changing anything.</Tip>

The client can use this new route by sending a `FormData` object with code something like this,
which would result in `the_data`, in the above code, containing `message` and `node_id` keys:

```Javascript
import { api } from "../../scripts/api.js";
function send_message(node_id, message) {
    const body = new FormData();
    body.append('message',message);
    body.append('node_id', node_id);
    api.fetchApi("/my_new_path", { method: "POST", body, });
}
```
