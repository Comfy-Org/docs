## What is a custom node?

One of the great powers of Comfy is that its node-based approach allows you to develop new workflows
by plugging together the nodes provided in different ways. The built-in nodes provide a wide range of 
functionality, but you may find that you need a feature not provided by a core node. 
Custom nodes allow you to implement new features and share them with the wider community. 

A custom node, like any Comfy node, essentially takes input, does something to it, and produces an output. 
While some custom nodes perform highly complex tasks, many just do one thing. Here's an example of a 
simple node that takes an image and inverts it.
