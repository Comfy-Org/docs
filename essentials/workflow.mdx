## What is a workflow?

ComfyUI serves as a node-based graphical user interface for visual Gen-AI.

You assemble a workflow by linking various blocks, referred to as nodes. A workflow can be made to create images, videos, audio, agents, or anything you can imagine.

## Get Started

The easiest way to get started is to try out some of the [official workflows](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples). 


## Next

The above workflows use core nodes provided by ComfyUI. ComfyUI also has a rich ecosystem of [custom nodes](https://registry.comfy.org) that you can use to create your own workflows.
