## Nodes perform operations

In computer science, a **_node_** is a container for information, usually including programmed instructions to perform some task. Nodes almost never exist in isolation, theyâ€™re almost always connected to other nodes in a networked graph. In ComfyUI, nodes take the visual form of boxes that are connected to each other.

ComfyUI nodes are usually **_function operators_**. This means that they operate on some data to perform a function. A function is a process that accepts input data, performs some operation on it, and produces output data. In other words, nodes do some work, contributing to the completion of a task such as generating an image. So ComfyUI nodes almost always have at least one input or output, and usually have multiple inputs and outputs.

## Custom Nodes

ComfyUI includes many powerful nodes in the base installation package. These are known as **Comfy Core** nodes. Additionally, the ComfyUI community has created an amazing array of [**_custom nodes_**](https://registry.comfy.org) to perform a wide variety of functions.




## ComfyUI Manager

The **ComfyUI Manager** window makes it easy to perform custom node management tasks such as search, install, update, disable, and uninstall. The Manager is included in the ComfyUI desktop application, but not in the ComfyUI server application. 

### Installing the Manager

If you're running the ComfyUI server application, you need to install the Manager. If ComfyUI is running, shut it down before proceeding.

The first step is to install Git, a command-line application for software version control. Git will download the ComfyUI Manager from [github.com](https://github.com). Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) and install it.

Once Git is installed, navigate to the ComfyUI server program directory, to the folder labeled **custom_nodes**. Open up a command window or terminal. Make sure that the command line displays the current directory path as **custom_nodes**. Enter the following command. This will download the Manager. Technically, this is known as _cloning a Git repository_.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager.git
```
