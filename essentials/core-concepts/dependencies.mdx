## A workflow file depends on other files

A ComfyUI workflow is usually not self-contained. In other words, a workflow can't function unless it can access the other files it needs. These are called **dependencies** because the primary document, the workflow file, **_depends_** on other files in order to do its work.

## Assets

An AI model is an example of an **_asset_**. In media production, an asset is some media file that supplies input data. For example, a video editing program operates on movie files stored on disk. The editing program’s project file holds links to these movie file assets, allowing non-destructive editing that doesn’t alter the original movie files.

ComfyUI works the same way. A workflow can only run if all of the required assets are found and loaded. Generative AI models, images, movies, and sounds are some examples of assets that a workflow might depend upon. These are therefore known as **_dependent assets_** or **_asset dependencies_**.

## Software

An advanced application like ComfyUI also has **_software dependencies_**. These are libraries of programming code and data that are required for the application to run. Custom nodes are examples of software dependencies. On an even more fundamental level, the Python programming environment is the ultimate dependency for ComfyUI. The correct version of Python is required to run a particular version of ComfyUI. Updates to Python, ComfyUI, and custom nodes can all be handled from the **ComfyUI Manager** window.
