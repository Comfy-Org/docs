## pytorch, tensors, and torch.Tensor 

All the core number crunching in Comfy is done by [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/). If your custom nodes are going
to get into the guts of stable diffusion you will need to become familiar with this library, which is way beyond
the scope of this introduction.

However, many custom nodes will need to manipulate images, latents and masks, each of which are represented internally
as `torch.Tensor`, so you'll want to bookmark the 
[documentation for torch.Tensor](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html).

`torch.Tensor` represents a tensor, which is the mathematical generalization of a vector or matrix to any number of dimensions.
A tensor's _rank_ is the number of dimensions it has (so a vector has _rank_ 1, a matrix _rank_ 2); its _shape_ describes the
size of each dimension. 

So an RGB image (of height H and width W) might be thought of as three arrays (one for each color channel), each measuring H x W,
which could be represented as a tensor with _shape_ `[H,W,3]`. In Comfy images almost always come in a batch (even if the batch
only contains a single image). `torch` always places the batch dimension first, so Comfy images have _shape_ `[B,H,W,3]`, generally
written as `[B,H,W,C]` where C stands for Channels.

### squeeze, unsqueeze, and reshape

If a tensor has a dimension of size 1 (known as a collapsed dimension), it is equivalent to the same tensor with that dimension removed
(a batch with 1 image is just an image). Removing such a collapsed dimension is referred to as squeezing, and
inserting one is known as unsqueezing. 

<Warning>Some torch code, and some custom node authors, will return a squeezed tensor when a dimension is collapsed - such 
as when a batch has only one member. This is a common cause of bugs!</Warning>

To represent the same data in a different shape is referred to as reshaping. This often requires you to know
the underlying data structure, so handle with care!

### Important notation

`torch.Tensor` supports most Python slice notation, iteration, and other common list-like operations. A tensor 
also has a `.shape` attribute which returns its size as a `torch.Size` (which is a subclass of `tuple` and can 
be treated as such).

There are three other important bits of notation you'll often see:

- `torch.Tensor` supports the use of `None` in slice notation
to indicate the insertion of a dimension of size 1.

- `:` is frequently used when slicing a tensor; this simply means 'keep the whole dimension'. 
It's like using `a[start:end]` in Python, but omitting the start point and end point.

- in methods which require a shape to be passed, it is often passed as a `tuple` of the dimensions, in 
which a single dimension can be given the size `-1`, indicating that the size of this dimension should
be calculated based on the total size of the data.

<Warning>When returning a tuple, which just contains a tensor, if you forget the trailing comma, 
it will be treated as `Tensor` not `tuple[Tensor]`. Because tensors support Python iteration, 
an iterator will iterate over the first dimension of the tensor.</Warning>

## Images

An IMAGE is a `torch.Tensor` with shape `[B,H,W,C]`, `C=3`. If you are going to save or load images, you will 
need to convert to and from `PIL.Image` format - see the code snippets below! Note that some `pytorch` operations
offer (or expect) `[B,C,H,W]`, known as 'channel first', for reasons of computational efficiency. Just be careful.

### Working with PIL.Image

If you want to load and save images, you'll want to use PIL:
```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
```

Load an image into a batch of size 1 (based on `LoadImage` source code in `nodes.py`)
```python
i = Image.open(image_path)
i = ImageOps.exif_transpose(i)
if i.mode == 'I':
    i = i.point(lambda i: i * (1 / 255))
image = i.convert("RGB")
image = np.array(image).astype(np.float32) / 255.0
image = torch.from_numpy(image)[None,]
```

Save a batch of images (based on `SaveImage` source code in `nodes.py`)
```python     
for (batch_number, image) in enumerate(images):
    i = 255. * image.cpu().numpy()
    img = Image.fromarray(np.clip(i, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8))
    filepath = # some path that takes the batch number into account
    img.save(filepath)
```

## Masks

A MASK is a `torch.Tensor` with shape `[B,C,H,W]` with `C=1`. However, it is not unusual for the `C` channel
and/or the `B` channel to be squeezed. So it's always worth checking (I generally suggest dropping a breakpoint
into the code)

## Latents

A LATENT is a `dict`; the latent sample is referenced by the key `samples` and has shape `[B,C,H,W]`, with `C=4`.

<Tip>MASK and LATENT are channel first, IMAGE is channel last</Tip>
