## LiteGraph

The Comfy UI is built on top of [LiteGraph](https://github.com/jagenjo/litegraph.js). 
Much of the Comfy functionality is provided by LiteGraph, so if developing more complex
nodes you will probably find it helpful to clone that repository and browse the documentation, 
which can be found at `doc/index.html`.

## ComfyApp

The `app` object (always accessible by `import { app } from "../../scripts/app.js";`) represents the Comfy application running in the browser,
and contains a number of useful properties and functions, some of which are listed below.

<Warning>Hijacking functions on `app` is not recommended, as Comfy is under constant development, and core behavior may change.</Warning>

### Properties

Important properties of `app` include (this is not an exhaustive list):

|property|contents|
|-|-|
|`canvas`|An LGraphCanvas object, representing the current user inferface. It contains some potentially interesting properties, such as `node_over` and `selected_nodes`.|
|`canvasEl`|The DOM `<canvas>` element|
|`graph`|A reference to the LGraph object describing the current graph|
|`runningNodeId`|During execution, the node currently being executed|
|`ui`|Provides access to some UI elements, such as the queue, menu, and dialogs|

`canvas` (for graphical elements) and `graph` (for logical connections) are probably the ones you are most likely to want to access. 

### Functions

Again, there are many. A few significant ones are:

|function|notes|
|-|-|
|graphToPrompt|Convert the graph into a prompt that can be sent to the Python server|
|loadGraphData|Load a graph|
|queuePrompt|Sumbit a prompt to the queue|
|registerExtension|You've seen this one - used to add an extension|

## LGraph

The `LGraph` object is part of the LiteGraph framework, and represents the current logical state of the graph (nodes and links). 
If you want to manipulate the graph, the LiteGraph documentation (at `doc/index.html` if you clone `https://github.com/jagenjo/litegraph.js`) 
describes the functions you will need.

You can use `graph` to obtain details of nodes and links, for example:

```Javascript
const ComfyNode_object_for_my_node = app.graph._nodes_by_id(my_node_id) 
ComfyNode_object_for_my_node.inputs.forEach(input => {
    const link_id = input.link;
    if (link_id) {
        const LLink_object = app.graph.links[link_id]
        const id_of_upstream_node = LLink_object.origin_id
        // etc
    }
});
```

## LLink

The `LLink` object, accessible through `graph.links`, represents a single link in the graph, from node `link.origin_id` output slot `link.origin_slot`
to node `link.target_id` slot `link.target_slot`. It also has a string representing the data type, in `link.type`, and `link.id`.

`LLink`s are created in the `connect` method of a `LGraphNode` (of which `ComfyNode` is a subclass). 

<Tip>Avoid creating your own LLink objects - use the LiteGraph functions instead.</Tip>

## ComfyNode

`ComfyNode` is a subclass of `LGraphNode`, and the LiteGraph documentation is therefore helpful for more generic
operations. However, Comfy has significantly extended the LiteGraph core behaviour, and also does not make 
use of all LiteGraph functionality.

<Tip>The description that follows applies to a normal node. 
Group nodes, primitive nodes, notes, and redirect nodes have different properties.</Tip>

A `ComfyNode` object represents a node in the current workflow. It has a number of important properties 
that you may wish to make use of, a very large number of functions that you may wish to use, or hijack to 
modify behaviour. 

To get a more complete sense of the node object, you may find it helpful to insert the following
code into your extension and place a breakpoint on the `console.log` command. When you then create a new node
you can use your favorite debugger to interrogate the node.

```Javascript
async nodeCreated(node) {
    console.log("nodeCreated")
}
```

### Properties

|property|contents|
|-|-|
|`bgcolor`|The background color of the node, or undefined for the default|
|`comfyClass`|The Python class representing the node| 
|`flags`|A dictionary that may contain flags related to the state of the node. In particular, `flags.collapsed` is true for collapsed nodes.|
|`graph`|A reference to the LGraph object|
|`id`|A unique id|
|`input_type`|A list of the input types (eg "STRING", "MODEL", "CLIP" etc). Generally matches the Python INPUT_TYPES|
|`inputs`|A list of inputs (discussed below)|
|`mode`|Normally 0, set to 2 if the node is muted and 4 if the node is bypassed. Values of 1 and 3 are not used by Comfy|
|`order`|The node's position in the execution order. Set by `Lgraph.computeExecutionOrder()` when the prompt is submitted|
|`pos`|The [x,y] position of the node on the canvas|
|`properties`|A dictionary containing `"Node name for S&R"`, used by LiteGraph|
|`properties_info`|The type and default value of entries in `properties`|
|`size`|The width and height of the node on the canvas|
|`title`|Display Title|
|`type`|The unique name (from Python) of the node class|
|`widgets`|A list of widgets (discussed below)|
|`widgets_values`|A list of the current values of widgets|


### Functions

There are a very large number of functions (85, last time I counted). A selection are listed below.

|function|notes|
|-|-|

## Inputs and Widgets

Inputs and Widgets represent the two ways that data can be fed into a node. In general a widget can be 
converted to an input, but not all inputs can be converted to a widget (as many datatypes can't be
entered through a UI element).

`node.inputs` is a list of the current inputs (colored dots on the left hand side of the node),
specifying their `.name`, `.type`, and `.link` (a reference to the connected `LLink` in `app.graph.links`). 

If an input is a widget which has been converted, it also holds a reference to the, now inactive, widget in `.widget`.

`node.widgets` is a list of all widgets, whether or not they have been converted to an input. A widget has:

|property/function|notes|
|-|-|
|`callback`|A function called when the widget value is changed|
|`last_y`|The vertical position of the widget in the node|
|`name`|The (unique within a node) widget name|
|`options`|As specified in the Python code (such as default, min, and max)|
|`type`|The name of the widget type (see below) in lowercase|
|`value`|The current widget value. This is a property with `get` and `set` methods|

### Widget Types

`app.widgets` is a dictionary of currently registered widget types, keyed in the UPPER CASE version of the name of the type. 
Build in Comfy widgets types include the self explainatory `BOOLEAN`, `INT`, and `FLOAT`, 
as well as `STRING` (which comes in two flavours, single line and multiline),
`COMBO` for dropdown selection from a list, and `IMAGEUPLOAD`, used in Load Image nodes.

Custom widget types can be added by providing a `getCustomWidgets` method in your extension.
{/* TODO add link */}

### Linked widgets

Widgets can also be linked - the built in behaviour of `seed` and `control_after_generate`, for example. 
A linked widget has `.type = 'base_widget_type:base_widget_name'`; so `control_after_generate` may have
type `int:seed`.
