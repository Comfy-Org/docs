## Function hijacking

A common JavaScript idiom used in extensions is to hijack 
existing function calls and insert additional behaviour. This can apply to the 
behaviour of a node, or of the core Comfy objects, in particular `app` (the Comfy application)
and `graph` (an extended `LiteGraph` object representing the graph).

A reminder of the basic idiom:
```Javascript
const the_original_function = the_object.the_function
the_object.the_function = function() {
    // might want to do something before the original code
    var return_value = the_original_function?.apply(this, arguments);
    // or after, possibly depending on, or changing, the return value
    return return_value
}
```
