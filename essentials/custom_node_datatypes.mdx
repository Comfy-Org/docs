title: "Datatypes"
---

These are the most important built in datatypes. You can also [define your own](./custom_node_more_on_inputs#custom-datatypes).

<Tip>datatypes are specified in `INPUT_TYPES` by a `str`, with the exception of `COMBO`, which is `list[str]`</Tip>

Datatypes are used on the client side to prevent a workflow from passing the wrong form of data into a node - a bit like strong typing. 
The JavaScript client side code will generally not allow a node output to be connected to an input of a different datatype, 
although a few exceptions are noted below.

## Comfy datatypes

### COMBO

* No additional parameters in `INPUT_TYPES`
* Python datatype: defined as `list[str]`, output value is `str`

Represents a dropdown menu widget. 
Unlike other datatypes, `COMBO` it is not specified in `INPUT_TYPES` by a `str`, but by a `list[str]` 
corresponding to the options in the dropdown list, with the first option selected by default.

`COMBO` inputs are often dynamically generated at run time. For instance, in the built-in `CheckpointLoaderSimple` node, you find 
```
"ckpt_name": (folder_paths.get_filename_list("checkpoints"), )
```
or they might just be a fixed list of options,
```
"play_sound": (["no","yes"], {}),
```

### Primitive and reroute

Primitive and reroute nodes only exist on the client side. They do not have an intrinsic datatype, but when connected they take on
the datatype of the input or output to which they have been connected (which is why they can't connect to a `*` input...)

## Python datatypes

### INT

* Additional parameters in `INPUT_TYPES`: 
    * `default` is required
    * `min` and `max` are optional
* Python datatype `int`

### FLOAT

* Additional parameters in `INPUT_TYPES`: 
    * `default` is required
    * `min`, `max`, `step` are optional
* Python datatype `float`

### STRING

* Additional parameters in `INPUT_TYPES`: 
    * `default` is required
* Python datatype `str`

## Tensor datatypes

<Warning>MASK, IMAGE, and LATENT all use the `torch.Tensor` type, but they have different _shape_.
See discussion in 'Images, Latents, and Masks'.</Warning>

### IMAGE

- No additional parameters in `INPUT_TYPES`
- Python datatype `torch.Tensor` with _shape_ [B,H,W,C]

A batch of `B` images, height `H`, width `W`, with `C` channels (generally `C=3` for `RGB`). 

### LATENT

- No additional parameters in `INPUT_TYPES`
- Python datatype `dict`, containing a `torch.Tensor` with _shape_ [B,C,H,W]

The `dict` passed contains the key `samples`, which is a `torch.Tensor` with _shape_ [B,C,H,W] representing 
a batch of `B` latents, with `C` channels (generally `C=4` for existing stable diffusion models), height `H`, width `W`. 

The height and width are 1/8 of the corresponding image size (which is the value you set in the Empty Latent Image node).

Other entries in the dictionary contain things like latent masks.
{/* TODO need to dig into this */}
{/* TODO new SD models might have different C values? */}

### MASK

- No additional parameters in `INPUT_TYPES`
- Python datatype `torch.Tensor` with _shape_ [H,W] or [B,C,H,W]

## Model datatypes

There are a number of more technical datatypes for stable diffusion models. The most significant ones are `MODEL`, `CLIP`, `VAE` and `CONDITIONING`.
Working with these is (for the time being) beyond the scope of this guide! {/* TODO but maybe not forever */}
