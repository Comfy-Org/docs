## Model Architecture Mismatch

**Symptoms:** Tensor dimension errors during generation, especially during VAE decode stage

**Common error messages:**
- `Given groups=1, weight of size [64, 4, 3, 3], expected input[1, 16, 128, 128] to have 4 channels, but got 16 channels instead`
- `Given groups=1, weight of size [4, 4, 1, 1], expected input[1, 16, 144, 112] to have 4 channels, but got 16 channels instead`
- `Given groups=1, weight of size [320, 4, 3, 3], expected input[2, 16, 192, 128] to have 4 channels, but got 16 channels instead`
- `The size of tensor a (49) must match the size of tensor b (16) at non-singleton dimension 1`
- `Tensors must have same number of dimensions: got 2 and 3`

**Root cause:** Using models from different architecture families together

### Solutions

1. **Verify model family compatibility:**
   - **Flux models** use 16-channel latent space with dual text encoder conditioning (CLIP-L + T5-XXL)
   - **SD1.5 models** use 4-channel latent space with single CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder
   - **SDXL models** use 4-channel latent space with dual text encoders (CLIP ViT-L/14 + OpenCLIP ViT-bigG/14)
   - **SD3 models** use 16-channel latent space with triple text encoder conditioning (CLIP-L + OpenCLIP bigG + T5-XXL)

2. **Common mismatch scenarios and fixes:**

   **Flux + wrong VAE:**
   ```
   Problem: Using taesd or sdxl_vae.safetensors with Flux checkpoint
   Fix: Use ae.safetensors (Flux VAE) from Hugging Face Flux releases
   ```

   **Flux + incorrect CLIP configuration:**
   ```
   Problem: Using t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors in both CLIP slots of DualClipLoader
   Fix: Use t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors in one slot and clip_l.safetensors in the other
   ```

   **ControlNet architecture mismatch:**
   ```
   Problem: SD1.5 ControlNet with different architecture checkpoint
   Fix: Use ControlNet models designed for your checkpoint architecture
   ```

3. **Quick diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   # Check if error occurs at VAE decode stage
   # Look for "expected input[X, Y, Z] to have N channels, but got M channels"
   # Y value indicates channel count: 4 = SD models, 16 = Flux models
   ```

4. **Prevention strategies:**
   - Keep all workflow models within the same architecture family
   - Download complete model packages from same source/release (often all in a Hugging Face repo)
   - When trying new models, start with the template workflows or official ComfyUI workflow examples before customizing

## Missing Models Error

**Example error message:** 
```
Prompt execution failed
Prompt outputs failed validation:
CheckpointLoaderSimple:
- Value not in list: ckpt_name: 'model-name.safetensors' not in []
```

### Solutions

1. **Download required models:**
   - Use ComfyUI Manager to auto-download models
   - Verify models are in correct subfolders

2. **Check model paths:**
   - **Checkpoints**: `models/checkpoints/`
   - **VAE**: `models/vae/`
   - **LoRA**: `models/loras/`
   - **ControlNet**: `models/controlnet/`
   - **Embeddings**: `models/embeddings/`

3. **Share models between UIs or use custom paths:**
   - See [ComfyUI Model Sharing and Custom Model Directory Configuration](/installation/comfyui_portable_windows#2-comfyui-model-sharing-and-custom-model-directory-configuration) for detailed instructions
   - Edit `extra_model_paths.yaml` file to add custom model directories

### Model Search Path Configuration

If you have models in custom locations, see the detailed guide for [ComfyUI Model Sharing and Custom Model Directory Configuration](/installation/comfyui_portable_windows#2-comfyui-model-sharing-and-custom-model-directory-configuration) to configure ComfyUI to find them.

## Model Loading Errors

**Error message:** "Error while deserializing header"

### Solutions

1. **Re-download the model** - File may be corrupted during download
2. **Check available disk space** - Ensure enough space for model loading (models can be 2-15GB+)
3. **Check file permissions** - Ensure ComfyUI can read the model files
4. **Test with different model** - Verify if issue is model-specific or system-wide

## Model Performance Issues

### Slow Model Loading

**Symptoms:** Long delays when switching models or starting generation

**Solutions:**
1. **Use faster storage:**
   - Move models to SSD if using HDD
   - Use NVMe SSD for best performance

2. **Adjust caching settings:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --cache-classic       # Use the old style (aggressive) caching. 
   python main.py --cache-lru 10         # Increase size of LRU cache
   ```

### Memory Issues with Large Models

**"RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory":**

```bash
# Progressive memory reduction
python main.py --lowvram          # First try
python main.py --novram           # If lowvram insufficient  
python main.py --cpu              # Last resort
```

**Model-specific memory optimization:**
```bash
# Force lower precision
python main.py --force-fp16

# Reduce attention memory usage
python main.py --use-pytorch-cross-attention
```
