## Quick Issue Diagnosis

If you're experiencing any of these issues, there is a high likelihood that it is caused by custom nodes:
- ComfyUI crashes or won't start
- "Failed to import" errors in console/logs
- UI completely breaks or shows blank screen
- "Prompt execution failed" errors not related to memory issues
- Missing nodes that should be available/installed

## Is It a Custom Node Problem?

Most ComfyUI issues are caused by custom nodes (extensions). Let's check if this is the case.

### Step 1: Test Without Custom Nodes

Run ComfyUI with all custom nodes disabled:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Desktop Users">
Start ComfyUI Desktop with custom nodes disabled from the settings menu, or run the server manually:

```bash
cd path/to/your/comfyui
python main.py --disable-all-custom-nodes
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Manual Install">
```bash
cd ComfyUI
python main.py --disable-all-custom-nodes
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Portable">
```bash
cd ComfyUI_windows_portable
python ComfyUI/main.py --disable-all-custom-nodes
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ **Issue disappears**: A custom node is causing the problem ‚Üí Continue to Step 2
- ‚ùå **Issue persists**: Not a custom node issue ‚Üí [Report the issue](#reporting-issues)

## Step 2: Find the Problematic Custom Node

We'll use **binary search** to quickly find which custom node is causing issues. This is much faster than testing nodes one by one.

### How Binary Search Works

Instead of testing each node individually (which could take hours), we split the nodes in half repeatedly:

```
8 nodes ‚Üí Test 4 nodes ‚Üí Test 2 nodes ‚Üí Test 1 node ‚úì

Example with 8 nodes:
1. Test nodes 1-4: Issue persists ‚úì ‚Üí Problem in remaining nodes 5-8
2. Test nodes 5-6: Issue gone ‚úì ‚Üí Problem in nodes 7-8  
3. Test node 7: Issue persists ‚úì ‚Üí Node 7 is the problem!

This takes only 3 tests instead of testing all 8 nodes individually.
```

### Binary Search Process

<Warning>
Before starting, **create a backup** of your custom_nodes folder in case something goes wrong.
</Warning>

#### Create Temporary Folders

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Windows">
```bash
# Create backup and temporary folder
mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\custom_nodes_backup"
mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\custom_nodes_temp"

# Backup everything first
xcopy "custom_nodes\*" "%USERPROFILE%\custom_nodes_backup\" /E /H /Y
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="macOS/Linux">
```bash
# Create backup and temporary folder
mkdir ~/custom_nodes_backup
mkdir ~/custom_nodes_temp

# Backup everything first
cp -r custom_nodes/* ~/custom_nodes_backup/
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Cloud/Colab">
```bash
# Create backup and temporary folder
mkdir /content/custom_nodes_backup
mkdir /content/custom_nodes_temp

# Backup everything first
cp -r /content/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/* /content/custom_nodes_backup/
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Find the Problematic Node

1. **List your custom nodes:**
   <Tabs>
   <Tab title="Windows">
   ```bash
   dir custom_nodes
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
   ```bash
   ls custom_nodes/
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Cloud/Colab">
   ```bash
   ls /content/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
   ```
   </Tab>
   </Tabs>

2. **Split nodes in half:**
   
   Let's say you have 8 custom nodes. Move the first half to temporary storage:

   <Tabs>
   <Tab title="Windows">
   ```bash
   # Move first half (nodes 1-4) to temp
   move "custom_nodes\node1" "%USERPROFILE%\custom_nodes_temp\"
   move "custom_nodes\node2" "%USERPROFILE%\custom_nodes_temp\"
   move "custom_nodes\node3" "%USERPROFILE%\custom_nodes_temp\"
   move "custom_nodes\node4" "%USERPROFILE%\custom_nodes_temp\"
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
   ```bash
   # Move first half (nodes 1-4) to temp
   mv custom_nodes/node1 ~/custom_nodes_temp/
   mv custom_nodes/node2 ~/custom_nodes_temp/
   mv custom_nodes/node3 ~/custom_nodes_temp/
   mv custom_nodes/node4 ~/custom_nodes_temp/
   ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Cloud/Colab">
   ```bash
   # Move first half (nodes 1-4) to temp
   mv /content/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/node1 /content/custom_nodes_temp/
   mv /content/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/node2 /content/custom_nodes_temp/
   mv /content/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/node3 /content/custom_nodes_temp/
   mv /content/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/node4 /content/custom_nodes_temp/
   ```
   </Tab>
   </Tabs>

3. **Test ComfyUI:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Interpret results:**
   - **Issue persists**: Problem is in the remaining nodes (5-8)
   - **Issue gone**: Problem was in the moved nodes (1-4)

5. **Narrow it down:**
   - If issue persists: Move half of remaining nodes (e.g., nodes 7-8) to temp
   - If issue gone: Move half of temp nodes (e.g., nodes 3-4) back to custom_nodes

6. **Repeat until you find the single problematic node**

### Visual Example

Let's walk through a complete example with 8 custom nodes:

```
üìÅ custom_nodes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîß ComfyUI-Manager
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üé® ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üñºÔ∏è ComfyUI-Impact-Pack
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîÑ ComfyUI-Workflow-Component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìä ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üé≠ ComfyUI-FaceRestore
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ö° ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üõ†Ô∏è ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack
```

**Round 1:** Move first 4 to temp
- Test ‚Üí Issue persists ‚úì
- Problem is in: ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved, ComfyUI-FaceRestore, ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet, ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack

**Round 2:** Move 2 of the remaining 4 to temp
- Test ‚Üí Issue gone ‚úì
- Problem is in: ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet, ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack

**Round 3:** Move 1 of the remaining 2 to temp
- Test ‚Üí Issue persists ‚úì
- **Found it!** ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack is the problematic node

## Step 3: Fix the Issue

Once you've identified the problematic custom node:

### Option 1: Update the Node
1. Check if there's an update available in ComfyUI Manager
2. Update the node and test again

### Option 2: Replace the Node
1. Look for alternative custom nodes with similar functionality
2. Check the [ComfyUI Registry](https://registry.comfy.org) for alternatives

### Option 3: Report the Issue
Contact the custom node developer:
1. Find the node's GitHub repository
2. Create an issue with:
   - Your ComfyUI version
   - Error messages/logs
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Your operating system

### Option 4: Remove or Disable the Node
If no fix is available and you don't need the functionality:
1. Remove the problematic node from `custom_nodes/` or disable it in the ComfyUI Manager interface
2. Restart ComfyUI
