---

## Accessing the manager

1. Click the **Manager** button on the main menu (top bar)

## Installing custom nodes

1. Click **Install Custom Nodes** from the Manager menu
2. Browse or search for the node you want to install
3. Click **Install** or **Try Install**

### Installation status indicators

- **Installed**: This item is already installed
- **Install**: Click to install the item
- **Try Install**: Installation information cannot be confirmed; click to attempt installation

### Database modes

There are three DB modes available:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **DB: Channel (1day cache)** | Uses cached channel information with a one-day validity period. This is the **default** mode. |
| **DB: Local** | Uses information stored locally in ComfyUI-Manager. Updated only when you update ComfyUI-Manager. |
| **DB: Channel (remote)** | Retrieves information from the remote channel, always displaying the latest list. |

<Note>
For custom node developers testing their nodes in `custom-node-list.json`, use the **Local** mode.
</Note>

### Channel indicator

If a red background **Channel** indicator appears at the top, it means you're not using the default channel. Many custom nodes may not appear in this state.

### Conflicted nodes

Nodes with a yellow background indicate conflicts with other extensions. Due to these conflicts, some nodes may not function correctly.

## Installing models

1. Click **Install Models** from the Manager menu
2. Browse or search for the model you want
3. Click **Install**

## Updating custom nodes

1. Click **Fetch Updates** to retrieve update data for custom nodes locally
2. Click **Update** button in the **Install Custom Nodes** menu to apply updates

## Installing missing nodes

When you load a workflow with missing nodes:

1. Click **Install Missing Custom Nodes** from the Manager menu
2. A list of extension nodes containing the missing nodes will appear
3. Install the required extensions

## Sharing workflows

You can share workflows by:
- Clicking the **Share** button at the bottom of the main menu
- Selecting **Share Output** from the Context Menu of an Image node

### Supported platforms

- [ComfyWorkflows](https://comfyworkflows.com/)
- [OpenArt](https://openart.ai/workflows/dev)
- [YouML](https://youml.com)
- Matrix channel

### Share settings

Configure sharing behavior in Manager menu > Share settings:
- **None**: Hide from main menu
- **All**: Show a dialog where you can select a title for sharing

## Snapshot manager

Snapshots save your current installation status, allowing you to restore to a previous state.

### Saving snapshots

Snapshots are automatically saved when you:
- Press **Save snapshot**
- Use **Update All** on Manager Menu

Snapshot files are stored in: `<USER_DIRECTORY>/default/ComfyUI-Manager/snapshots`

### Restoring snapshots

1. Open the Snapshot Manager
2. Select a snapshot
3. Press **Restore**

<Note>
Restoration takes effect on the next ComfyUI startup. For custom nodes not managed by Git, snapshot support is incomplete.
</Note>

## Component sharing

### Copy and paste

Components support JSON format for clipboard sharing:

```json
{
  "kind": "ComfyUI Components",
  "timestamp": <current timestamp>,
  "components": {
    "<component name>": "<component nodedata>"
  }
}
```

Component names should be in the format `<prefix>::<node name>`.

### Drag and drop

Drag and drop `.pack` or `.json` files to add components.

### Component behavior

- Dragging/pasting a single component adds a node
- Adding multiple components does not add nodes automatically

## Additional features

### Fix node (recreate)

Right-click on a node and select **Fix node (recreate)** to recreate the node. Widget values are reset while connections with the same names are maintained.

Use this to correct errors in nodes from old workflows that are incompatible with newer custom node versions.

<Note>
The double-click node title feature has been removed in V3.10 and moved to [comfyui-connection-helper](https://github.com/ltdrdata/comfyui-connection-helper).
