## Common issues

### Custom git executable path

If your `git.exe` is installed in a specific location other than the system default:

1. Install ComfyUI-Manager and run ComfyUI once
2. Open `<USER_DIRECTORY>/default/ComfyUI-Manager/config.ini`
3. Specify the full path including the file name in `git_exe =`

```ini
git_exe = C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe
```

### ComfyUI-Manager update fails

If updating ComfyUI-Manager itself fails, go to the ComfyUI-Manager directory and run:

```bash
git update-ref refs/remotes/origin/main a361cc1 && git fetch --all && git pull
```

### Windows: Overlapped Object error

If you encounter `Overlapped Object has pending operation at deallocation on ComfyUI Manager load`:

Edit `config.ini` and add:

```ini
windows_selector_event_loop_policy = True
```

### SSL certificate verification failed

If you encounter `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error:

Edit `config.ini` and add:

```ini
bypass_ssl = True
```

## Installation issues

### Incorrect installation path

ComfyUI-Manager files must be located in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-manager`.

**Common mistakes to avoid:**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Files in wrong location | Manager files like `__init__.py` placed directly in `custom_nodes` directory |
| Double nested folder | Installed as `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/ComfyUI-Manager` |
| Wrong folder name | Installed as `custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager-main` |
| Compressed format | Installing from a compressed file without proper extraction |

<Warning>
If installed incorrectly, ComfyUI-Manager may appear to work but won't be recognized for updates and may cause duplicate installations. Remove it and reinstall properly via `git clone`.
</Warning>

## Network issues

### GitHub access problems

If you have limited access to GitHub, set the `GITHUB_ENDPOINT` environment variable:

```bash
GITHUB_ENDPOINT=https://mirror.ghproxy.com/https://github.com
```

### Hugging Face access problems

If you have limited access to Hugging Face, set the `HF_ENDPOINT` environment variable:

```bash
HF_ENDPOINT=https://some-hf-mirror.com
```

## Scanner troubleshooting

When running the `scan.sh` script:

- It updates `extension-node-map.json` by pulling or cloning custom nodes listed in `custom-node-list.json` into `~/.tmp/default`
- It updates `github-stats.json` using the GitHub API

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--skip-update` | Skip updating extension-node-map.json |
| `--skip-stat-update` | Skip updating github-stats.json |
| `--skip-all` | Skip both update steps |

<Tip>
To avoid GitHub API rate limits, set your token: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here`
</Tip>

If you want to specify a different path instead of `~/.tmp/default`, run `python scanner.py [path]` directly instead of `scan.sh`.

## Security policy

Configure security levels in `config.ini`:

```ini
security_level = normal
```

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `strong` | Doesn't allow high and middle level risky features |
| `normal` | Doesn't allow high level risky features; middle level features available |
| `normal-` | Doesn't allow high level risky features if `--listen` is specified and not starts with `127.`; middle level features available |
| `weak` | All features available |

### Risk levels for features

| Risk Level | Features |
|------------|----------|
| **High** | Install via git url, pip install, installation of custom nodes not in default channel, fix custom nodes |
| **Middle** | Uninstall/Update, installation of custom nodes in default channel, restore/remove snapshot, restart |
| **Low** | Update ComfyUI |
