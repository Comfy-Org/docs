## Common questions
1. Why can't I find the node I need?
The new Manager only supports installing nodes from the [registry](/registry/overview). If your node is not registered in the registry, please register it in the Manager first.

2. Why can't I find the option to install via git?
For security and stability of the ComfyUI user system, the new UI does not support installing nodes via git. Please refer to [Manually install custom nodes](/installation/install_custom_node) to learn how to manually install custom nodes.
