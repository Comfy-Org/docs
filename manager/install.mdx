## Desktop users

If you're using [ComfyUI Desktop](/installation/desktop/windows), ComfyUI-Manager is already included and enabled by default. No additional installation is required.

## Portable users

For users running the [Windows Portable](/installation/comfyui_portable_windows) version, the new ComfyUI-Manager is built into ComfyUI core but needs to be enabled.

1. Install the manager dependencies:
   ```bash
   .\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI\manager_requirements.txt
   ```

2. Launch ComfyUI with the manager enabled:
   ```bash
   .\python_embeded\python.exe -s ComfyUI\main.py --windows-standalone-build --enable-manager
   pause
   ```

## Manual install users

For users with a [manual installation](/installation/manual_install), the new ComfyUI-Manager is built into ComfyUI core but needs to be enabled.

   # Linux/macOS

   ```

2. Install the manager dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r manager_requirements.txt
