## Comfy Cloud

<Note>
Comfy Cloud does not currently support installing custom nodes. If you need specific custom nodes or features, please leave a message in [support](/support/contact-support) or submit feedback so we know what features you want to use.

### Installation status indicators

- **Installed**: This item is already installed
- **Install**: Click to install the item
- **Try Install**: Installation information cannot be confirmed; click to attempt installation

### Database modes

There are three DB modes for the node list:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `DB: Channel (1day cache)` | Uses cached channel information (1-day validity) for quick display. This is the **default** mode. |
| `DB: Local` | Uses information stored locally in ComfyUI-Manager. Updated only when you update ComfyUI-Manager. |
| `DB: Channel (remote)` | Retrieves information from the remote channel, always displaying the latest list. |

<Note>
If a red background `Channel` indicator appears at the top, it means you're not using the default channel. Many custom nodes may not appear in this state.
</Note>

## Installing models

2. Browse or search for the model you want
3. Click **Install**

2. Click **Update** button in the **Install Custom Nodes** menu to apply updates

## Snapshot manager

Snapshots save your current installation status, allowing you to restore to a previous state.

![Snapshot manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-extension-tutorials/Main/ComfyUI-Manager/images/snapshot.jpg)

Snapshots are automatically saved when you press **Save snapshot** or use **Update All**. Snapshot files are stored in: `<USER_DIRECTORY>/default/ComfyUI-Manager/snapshots`

To restore: Open the Snapshot Manager, select a snapshot, and press **Restore**.

<Note>
Restoration takes effect on the next ComfyUI startup. For custom nodes not managed by Git, snapshot support is incomplete.
</Note>

## Fix node (recreate)

Right-click on a node and select **Fix node (recreate)** to recreate the node. Widget values are reset while connections with the same names are maintained. This is useful for correcting errors in nodes from old workflows that are incompatible with newer custom node versions.
