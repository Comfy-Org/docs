2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager comfyui-manager
   ```
3. Restart ComfyUI

### Method 2: Portable ComfyUI version (Windows)

1. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - Use standalone version
   - Select option: "use windows default console window"
2. Download [install-manager-for-portable-version.bat](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/raw/main/scripts/install-manager-for-portable-version.bat) into your `ComfyUI_windows_portable` directory
   - Right-click the link and choose "Save As..."
3. Double-click `install-manager-for-portable-version.bat`

### Method 3: Using comfy-cli (recommended)

### Method 4: Linux with venv

Prerequisites: `python-is-python3`, `python3-venv`, `git`

1. Download [install-comfyui-venv-linux.sh](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/raw/main/scripts/install-comfyui-venv-linux.sh) into an empty install directory
   - Right-click the link and choose "Save As..."
2. Make executable and run:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install-comfyui-venv-linux.sh
   ./install-comfyui-venv-linux.sh
   ```

You can execute ComfyUI by running either `./run_gpu.sh` or `./run_cpu.sh` depending on your system configuration.

## Installation precautions

<Warning>
ComfyUI-Manager files must be accurately located in the path `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-manager`
</Warning>

**Do not:**
- Decompress directly into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` location, resulting in Manager contents like `__init__.py` being placed directly in that directory
- Install in a path like `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/ComfyUI-Manager`
- Install in a path like `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager-main`

If installed incorrectly, ComfyUI-Manager may operate but won't be recognized for updates and poses the risk of duplicate installations. Remove it and install properly via `git clone` method.

## Google Colab

Use the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager/blob/main/notebooks/comfyui_colab_with_manager.ipynb) to run ComfyUI with ComfyUI-Manager:

- Supports installing ComfyUI
- Supports basic installation of ComfyUI-Manager
- Automatically installs dependencies of custom nodes upon restarting Colab notebooks
