description: An extension to manage custom nodes, models, and more in ComfyUI
---

**ComfyUI-Manager** is an extension designed to enhance the usability of [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). It offers management functions to **install, remove, disable, and enable** various custom nodes of ComfyUI. Furthermore, this extension provides a hub feature and convenience functions to access a wide range of information within ComfyUI.

## Key features

- **Custom node management**: Install, update, remove, and disable custom nodes
- **Model management**: Download and manage models from various sources
- **Snapshot management**: Save and restore installation states
- **Workflow sharing**: Share workflows to platforms like ComfyWorkflows, OpenArt, and YouML
- **Missing node detection**: Automatically detect and install missing nodes from workflows
- **Component sharing**: Copy, paste, and drag-drop workflow components

## UI modes

ComfyUI-Manager has two UI modes:

- **New UI**: The default modern interface integrated with ComfyUI
- **Legacy UI**: The original manager interface for users who prefer the classic experience

You can switch between modes using the `--enable-manager-legacy-ui` flag when starting ComfyUI.

## Installation

### Desktop users

If you're using [ComfyUI Desktop](/installation/desktop/windows), ComfyUI-Manager is already included and enabled by default. No additional installation is required.

### Portable and manual install users

For users running the [Windows Portable](/installation/comfyui_portable_windows) version or a [manual installation](/installation/manual_install), the new ComfyUI-Manager is built into ComfyUI core but needs to be enabled.

1. Install the manager dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r manager_requirements.txt
   ```

2. Enable the manager with the `--enable-manager` flag when running ComfyUI:
   ```bash
   python main.py --enable-manager
   ```

#### Command line options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--enable-manager` | Enable ComfyUI-Manager |
| `--enable-manager-legacy-ui` | Use the legacy manager UI instead of the new UI (requires `--enable-manager`) |
| `--disable-manager-ui` | Disable the manager UI and endpoints while keeping background features (requires `--enable-manager`) |

<Warning>
**Installation precautions:**
- ComfyUI-Manager files must be accurately located in the path `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-manager`
- Do not decompress directly into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` (files like `__init__.py` should not be in that directory)
- Do not install in paths like `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/ComfyUI-Manager` or `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager-main`

### Sharing workflows

Share workflows by clicking the **Share** button at the bottom of the main menu.

![Share dialog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-extension-tutorials/Main/ComfyUI-Manager/images/share.jpg)

Supported platforms:
- [ComfyWorkflows](https://comfyworkflows.com/)
- [OpenArt](https://openart.ai/workflows/dev)
- [YouML](https://youml.com)
- Matrix channel

You can configure share behavior in the Manager menu under **Share settings**:
- `None`: Hide from main menu
- `All`: Show a dialog where you can select a title for sharing

### Snapshot manager

Snapshots save your current installation status, allowing you to restore to a previous state.

![Snapshot manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-extension-tutorials/Main/ComfyUI-Manager/images/snapshot.jpg)

Snapshots are automatically saved when you press **Save snapshot** or use **Update All**. Snapshot files are stored in: `<USER_DIRECTORY>/default/ComfyUI-Manager/snapshots`

To restore: Open the Snapshot Manager, select a snapshot, and press **Restore**.

<Note>
Restoration takes effect on the next ComfyUI startup. For custom nodes not managed by Git, snapshot support is incomplete.
</Note>

### Component sharing

ComfyUI-Manager supports sharing workflow components through copy/paste and drag-drop.

**Copy & Paste**: Components can be pasted from the clipboard in JSON format. See the [demo page](https://ltdrdata.github.io/component-demo/) for examples.

**Drag & Drop**: Drag and drop `.pack` or `.json` files to add components.

### Additional features

#### Fix node (recreate)

Right-click on a node and select **Fix node (recreate)** to recreate the node. Widget values are reset while connections with the same names are maintained. This is useful for correcting errors in nodes from old workflows that are incompatible with newer custom node versions.

#### Double-click node title

You can configure double-click behavior in the Manager menu:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Copy All Connections` | Copies all connections from the nearest node (within 1000 pixels) |
| `Copy Input Connections` | Copies only input connections from the nearest node |
| `Possible Input Connections` | Connects all outputs that match the closest type from nodes on the left |
| `Possible(left) + Copy(right)` | Left half of title uses "Possible Input", right half uses "Copy All" |
