## Installation

### Desktop users

If you're using [ComfyUI Desktop](/installation/desktop/windows), ComfyUI-Manager is already included and enabled by default. No additional installation is required.

### Portable and manual install users

For users running the [Windows Portable](/installation/comfyui_portable_windows) version or a [manual installation](/installation/manual_install), the new ComfyUI-Manager is built into ComfyUI core but needs to be enabled.

1. Install the manager dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r manager_requirements.txt
   ```

2. Enable the manager with the `--enable-manager` flag when running ComfyUI:
   ```bash
   python main.py --enable-manager
   ```

#### Command line options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--enable-manager` | Enable ComfyUI-Manager |
| `--enable-manager-legacy-ui` | Use the legacy manager UI instead of the new UI (requires `--enable-manager`) |
| `--disable-manager-ui` | Disable the manager UI and endpoints while keeping background features (requires `--enable-manager`) |

### Legacy installation (standalone custom node)

To install ComfyUI-Manager as a standalone custom node:

1. Navigate to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory in terminal
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager comfyui-manager
