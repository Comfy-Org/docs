<Warning>
Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All your data, workflows, and settings will be permanently removed.
</Warning>

## Before you delete

Before proceeding with account deletion, consider:

- **Backup your data**: For Comfy Cloud users, your assets are stored under your account, so back up any data you want to keep. If you don't use Comfy Cloud, your API usage can be found at https://platform.comfy.org/
- **Cancel subscriptions**: Ensure all active subscriptions are cancelled to avoid future charges
- **Download invoices**: Save copies of any payment history or invoices you may need
- **Alternative options**: Consider deactivating your account temporarily instead of permanent deletion

## Deleting your Comfy account

To permanently delete your Comfy account for ComfyUI, send a deletion request to [support@comfy.org](mailto:support@comfy.org).

Include the following in your email:
- The email address associated with your account
- A clear statement requesting account deletion (e.g., "I request the deletion of my account and all associated personal data")

Under GDPR and similar data protection regulations, you have the right to request deletion of your personal data. We will process your request within 30 days and send you a confirmation once your account and data have been permanently deleted.
