Account deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. All your data, workflows, and settings will be permanently removed.

## Before you delete

Before proceeding with account deletion, consider:

- **Backup your data**: For Comfy Cloud users, your assets are stored under your account, so back up any data you want to keep. If you don't use Comfy Cloud, your API usage can be found at https://platform.comfy.org/
- **Cancel subscriptions**: Ensure all active subscriptions are cancelled to avoid future charges
- **Download invoices**: Save copies of any payment history or invoices you may need
- **Alternative options**: Consider deactivating your account temporarily instead of permanent deletion
