The `CLIPTextEncodeHunyuanDiT` node's main function is to convert input text into a form that the model can understand. It is an advanced conditioning node specifically designed for the dual text encoder architecture of the HunyuanDiT model.
Its primary role is like a translator, converting our text descriptions into "machine language" that the AI model can understand. The `bert` and `mt5xl` inputs prefer different types of prompt inputs.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `clip` | CLIP | A CLIP model instance used for text tokenization and encoding, which is core to generating conditions. |
| `bert` | STRING | Text input for encoding, prefers phrases and keywords, supports multiline and dynamic prompts. |
| `mt5xl` | STRING | Another text input for encoding, supports multiline and dynamic prompts (multilingual), can use complete sentences and complex descriptions. |

## Outputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `CONDITIONING` | CONDITIONING | The encoded conditional output used for further processing in generation tasks. |
