The Runway Text to Image node generates images from text prompts using Runway's Gen 4 model. You can provide a text description and optionally include a reference image to guide the image generation process. The node handles the API communication and returns the generated image.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `prompt` | STRING | Yes | - | Text prompt for the generation (default: "") |
| `ratio` | COMBO | Yes | "16:9"<br />"1:1"<br />"21:9"<br />"2:3"<br />"3:2"<br />"4:5"<br />"5:4"<br />"9:16"<br />"9:21" | Aspect ratio for the generated image |
| `reference_image` | IMAGE | No | - | Optional reference image to guide the generation |

**Note:** The reference image must have dimensions not exceeding 7999x7999 pixels and an aspect ratio between 0.5 and 2.0. When a reference image is provided, it guides the image generation process.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
