This node uses the Tencent Hunyuan3D API to perform UV unfolding on a 3D model. It takes a 3D model file as input, sends it to the API for processing, and returns the processed model in OBJ and FBX formats along with a generated UV texture image.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model_3d` | FILE3D | Yes | GLB<br />OBJ<br />FBX | Input 3D model (GLB, OBJ, or FBX). The model must have less than 30000 faces. |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 2147483647 | A seed value (default: 1). This controls whether the node should re-run, but results are non-deterministic regardless of the seed value. |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `OBJ` | FILE3D | The processed 3D model file in OBJ format. |
| `FBX` | FILE3D | The processed 3D model file in FBX format. |
| `Image` | IMAGE | The generated UV texture image. |
