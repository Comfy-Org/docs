|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model` | COMBO | Yes | `"viduq2-pro"`<br />`"viduq2-turbo"` | The AI model to use for video extension. Selecting a model reveals its specific duration and resolution settings. |
| `model.duration` | INT | Yes | 1 to 7 | The duration of the extended video in seconds (default: 4). This setting appears after selecting a model. |
| `model.resolution` | COMBO | Yes | `"720p"`<br />`"1080p"` | The resolution of the output video. This setting appears after selecting a model. |
| `video` | VIDEO | Yes | - | The source video to extend. |

| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 2147483647 | A seed value for controlling the randomness of the generation (default: 1). |
| `end_frame` | IMAGE | No | - | An optional image to use as the target end frame for the extension. If provided, its aspect ratio must be between 1:4 and 4:1, and its dimensions must be at least 128x128 pixels. |

**Note:** The source `video` must have a duration between 4 and 55 seconds.
