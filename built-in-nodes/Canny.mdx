Extract all edge lines from photos, like using a pen to outline a photo, drawing out the contours and detail boundaries of objects.

## Working Principle

Imagine you are an artist who needs to use a pen to outline a photo. The Canny node acts like an intelligent assistant, helping you decide where to draw lines (edges) and where not to.

This process is like a screening job:

- **High threshold** is the "must draw line standard": only very obvious and clear contour lines will be drawn, such as facial contours of people and building frames
- **Low threshold** is the "definitely don't draw line standard": edges that are too weak will be ignored to avoid drawing noise and meaningless lines
- **Middle area**: edges between the two standards will be drawn together if they connect to "must draw lines", but won't be drawn if they are isolated

The final output is a black and white image, where white parts are detected edge lines and black parts are areas without edges.

## Inputs

| Parameter Name   | Data Type | Input Type | Default | Range     | Function Description |
|------------------|-----------|------------|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| `image`          | IMAGE     | Input      | -       | -         | Original photo that needs edge extraction |
| `low_threshold`  | FLOAT     | Widget     | 0.4     | 0.01-0.99 | Low threshold, determines how weak edges to ignore. Lower values preserve more details but may produce noise |
| `high_threshold` | FLOAT     | Widget     | 0.8     | 0.01-0.99 | High threshold, determines how strong edges to preserve. Higher values only keep the most obvious contour lines |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `image`     | IMAGE     | Black and white edge image, white lines are detected edges, black areas are parts without edges |

**Common Issues:**

- Broken edges: Try lowering high threshold
- Too much noise: Raise low threshold
- Missing important details: Lower low threshold
- Edges too rough: Check input image quality and resolution
