The `GenerateTracks` node creates multiple parallel motion paths for video generation. It defines a primary path from a start point to an end point, then generates a set of tracks that run parallel to this path, spaced evenly apart. You can control the shape of the path (straight line or Bezier curve), the speed of movement along it, and which frames the tracks are visible in.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `width` | INT | Yes | 16 - 4096 | The width of the video frame in pixels. The default value is 832. |
| `height` | INT | Yes | 16 - 4096 | The height of the video frame in pixels. The default value is 480. |
| `start_x` | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 - 1.0 | Normalized X coordinate (0-1) for start position. The default value is 0.0. |
| `start_y` | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 - 1.0 | Normalized Y coordinate (0-1) for start position. The default value is 0.0. |
| `end_x` | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 - 1.0 | Normalized X coordinate (0-1) for end position. The default value is 1.0. |
| `end_y` | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 - 1.0 | Normalized Y coordinate (0-1) for end position. The default value is 1.0. |
| `num_frames` | INT | Yes | 1 - 1024 | The total number of frames for which to generate track positions. The default value is 81. |
| `num_tracks` | INT | Yes | 1 - 100 | The number of parallel tracks to generate. The default value is 5. |
| `track_spread` | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 - 1.0 | Normalized distance between tracks. Tracks are spread perpendicular to the motion direction. The default value is 0.025. |
| `bezier` | BOOLEAN | Yes | True / False | Enable Bezier curve path using the mid point as control point. The default value is False. |
| `mid_x` | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 - 1.0 | Normalized X control point for Bezier curve. Only used when 'bezier' is enabled. The default value is 0.5. |
| `mid_y` | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 - 1.0 | Normalized Y control point for Bezier curve. Only used when 'bezier' is enabled. The default value is 0.5. |
| `interpolation` | COMBO | Yes | `"linear"`<br />`"ease_in"`<br />`"ease_out"`<br />`"ease_in_out"`<br />`"constant"` | Controls the timing/speed of movement along the path. The default value is "linear". |
| `track_mask` | MASK | No | - | Optional mask to indicate visible frames. |

**Note:** The `mid_x` and `mid_y` parameters are only used when the `bezier` parameter is set to `True`. When `bezier` is `False`, the path is a straight line from the start to the end point.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `TRACKS` | TRACKS | A tracks object containing the generated path coordinates and visibility information for all tracks across all frames. |
| `track_length` | INT | The number of frames for which tracks were generated, matching the input `num_frames`. |
