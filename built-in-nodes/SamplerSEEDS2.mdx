This node provides a configurable sampler for generating images. It implements the SEEDS-2 algorithm, which is a stochastic differential equation (SDE) solver. By adjusting its parameters, you can configure it to behave like several specific samplers, including `seeds_2`, `exp_heun_2_x0`, and `exp_heun_2_x0_sde`.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `solver_type` | COMBO | Yes | `"phi_1"`<br />`"phi_2"` | Selects the underlying solver algorithm for the sampler. |
| `eta` | FLOAT | No | 0.0 - 100.0 | Stochastic strength (default: 1.0). |
| `s_noise` | FLOAT | No | 0.0 - 100.0 | SDE noise multiplier (default: 1.0). |
| `r` | FLOAT | No | 0.01 - 1.0 | Relative step size for the intermediate stage (c2 node) (default: 0.5). |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `sampler` | SAMPLER | A configured sampler object that can be passed to other sampling nodes. |
