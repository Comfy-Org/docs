The VAESave node is designed for saving VAE models along with their metadata, including prompts and additional PNG information, to a specified output directory. It encapsulates the functionality to serialize the model state and associated information into a file, facilitating the preservation and sharing of trained models.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `vae`     | VAE       | The VAE model to be saved. This parameter is crucial as it represents the model whose state is to be serialized and stored. |
| `filename_prefix` | STRING   | A prefix for the filename under which the model and its metadata will be saved. This allows for organized storage and easy retrieval of models. |

## Outputs

The node doesn't have output types.
