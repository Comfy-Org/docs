The ManualSigmas node allows you to manually define a custom sequence of noise levels (sigmas) for the sampling process. You input a list of numbers as a string, and the node converts them into a tensor that can be used by other sampling nodes. This is useful for testing or creating specific noise schedules.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `sigmas` | STRING | Yes | Any comma or space-separated numbers | A string containing the sigma values. The node will extract all numbers from this string. For example, "1, 0.5, 0.1" or "1 0.5 0.1". The default value is "1, 0.5". |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `sigmas` | SIGMAS | The tensor containing the sequence of sigma values extracted from the input string. |
