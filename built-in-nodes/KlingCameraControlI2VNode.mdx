The Kling Image to Video Camera Control Node transforms still images into cinematic videos with professional camera movements. This specialized image-to-video node allows you to control virtual camera actions including zoom, rotation, pan, tilt, and first-person view while maintaining focus on your original image. Camera control is currently only supported in pro mode with the kling-v1-5 model at 5-second duration.
