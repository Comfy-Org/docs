The Grok Image Edit node modifies an existing image based on a text prompt. It uses the Grok API to generate one or more new images that are variations of the input, guided by your description.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model` | COMBO | Yes | `"grok-imagine-image-beta"` | The specific AI model to use for image editing. |
| `image` | IMAGE | Yes | | The input image to be edited. Only one image is supported. |
| `prompt` | STRING | Yes | | The text prompt used to generate the edited image. |
| `resolution` | COMBO | Yes | `"1K"` | The resolution for the output image. |
| `number_of_images` | INT | No | 1 to 10 | Number of edited images to generate (default: 1). |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 2147483647 | Seed to determine if node should re-run; actual results are nondeterministic regardless of seed (default: 0). |

**Note:** The `image` input must contain exactly one image. Providing multiple images will cause an error.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | IMAGE | The edited image(s) generated by the node. If `number_of_images` is greater than 1, the outputs are concatenated into a batch. |
