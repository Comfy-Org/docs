The LTXV Audio VAE Decode node converts a latent representation of audio back into an audio waveform. It uses a specialized Audio VAE model to perform this decoding process, producing an audio output with a specific sample rate.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `samples` | LATENT | Yes | N/A | The latent to be decoded. |
| `audio_vae` | VAE | Yes | N/A | The Audio VAE model used for decoding the latent. |

**Note:** If the provided latent is nested (contains multiple latents), the node will automatically use the last latent in the sequence for decoding.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `Audio` | AUDIO | The decoded audio waveform and its associated sample rate. |
