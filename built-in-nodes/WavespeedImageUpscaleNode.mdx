The WaveSpeed Image Upscale node uses an external AI service to increase the resolution and quality of an image. It takes a single input photo and upscales it to a higher target resolution, such as 2K, 4K, or 8K, producing a sharper and more detailed result.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model` | STRING | Yes | `"SeedVR2"`<br />`"Ultimate"` | The AI model to use for upscaling. "SeedVR2" and "Ultimate" offer different quality and pricing tiers. |
| `image` | IMAGE | Yes | | The input image to be upscaled. |
| `target_resolution` | STRING | Yes | `"2K"`<br />`"4K"`<br />`"8K"` | The desired output resolution for the upscaled image. |

**Note:** This node requires exactly one input image. Providing a batch of images will result in an error.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | The upscaled, high-resolution output image. |
