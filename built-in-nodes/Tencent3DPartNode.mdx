This node uses the Tencent Hunyuan3D API to automatically analyze a 3D model and generate or identify its components based on its structure. It processes the model and returns a new FBX file.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model_3d` | FILE3D | Yes | FBX, Any | The 3D model to process. The model should be in FBX format and have less than 30000 faces. |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 2147483647 | A seed value to control whether the node should re-run. The results are non-deterministic regardless of the seed value. (default: 0) |

**Note:** The `model_3d` input only supports files in the FBX format. If a different 3D file format is provided, the node will raise an error.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `FBX` | FILE3DFBX | The processed 3D model, returned as an FBX file. |
