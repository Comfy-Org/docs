The Random Crop Images node randomly selects a rectangular section from each input image and crops it to a specified width and height. This is commonly used for data augmentation to create variations of training images. The random position for the crop is determined by a seed value, ensuring the same crop can be reproduced.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The image to be cropped. |
| `width` | INT | No | 1 - 8192 | The width of the crop area (default: 512). |
| `height` | INT | No | 1 - 8192 | The height of the crop area (default: 512). |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 - 18446744073709551615 | A number used to control the random position of the crop (default: 0). |

**Note:** The `width` and `height` parameters must be less than or equal to the dimensions of the input image. If a specified dimension is larger than the image, the crop will be limited to the image's boundary.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | The resulting image after the random crop has been applied. |
