The Video Slice node allows you to extract a specific segment from a video. You can define a start time and a duration to trim the video, or simply skip the beginning frames. If the requested duration is longer than the remaining video, the node can either return what's available or raise an error.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `video` | VIDEO | Yes | - | The input video to be sliced. |
| `start_time` | FLOAT | No | -1e5 to 1e5 | The start time in seconds from which to begin the slice. A negative value will skip frames from the beginning of the video. (default: 0.0) |
| `duration` | FLOAT | No | 0.0 and above | The length of the slice in seconds. A value of 0.0 means the node will return all video from the start time to the end. (default: 0.0) |
| `strict_duration` | BOOLEAN | No | - | If set to True, the node will raise an error if the requested duration cannot be met (e.g., if the slice would go beyond the end of the video). If False, it will return the available video up to the end. (default: False) |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `video` | VIDEO | The trimmed video segment. |
