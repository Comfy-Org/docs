This node uses the Tencent Hunyuan3D API to edit the textures of a 3D model. You provide a 3D model and a text description of the desired changes, and the node returns a new version of the model with its textures redrawn according to your prompt.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model_3d` | FILE3D | Yes | FBX, Any | 3D model in FBX format. Model should have less than 100000 faces. |
| `prompt` | STRING | Yes | | Describes texture editing. Supports up to 1024 UTF-8 characters. |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 2147483647 | Seed controls whether the node should re-run; results are non-deterministic regardless of seed. (default: 0) |

**Note:** The `model_3d` input must be a file in the FBX format. Other 3D file formats are not supported by this node.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `GLB` | FILE3D | The processed 3D model in GLB format. |
| `FBX` | FILE3D | The processed 3D model in FBX format. |
