The LatentCutToBatch node takes a latent representation and splits it along a specified dimension into multiple slices. These slices are then stacked into a new batch dimension, effectively converting a single latent sample into a batch of smaller latent samples. This is useful for processing different parts of a latent space independently.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `samples` | LATENT | Yes | - | The latent representation to be split and batched. |
| `dim` | COMBO | Yes | `"t"`<br />`"x"`<br />`"y"` | The dimension along which to cut the latent samples. `"t"` refers to the temporal dimension, `"x"` to the width, and `"y"` to the height. |
| `slice_size` | INT | Yes | 1 to 16384 | The size of each slice to cut from the specified dimension. If the dimension's size is not perfectly divisible by this value, the remainder is discarded. (default: 1) |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `samples` | LATENT | The resulting latent batch, containing the sliced and stacked samples. |
