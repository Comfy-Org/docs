This node merges multiple text lists into a single, combined list. It is designed to receive text inputs as lists and concatenates them together. The node logs the total number of texts in the merged list.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `texts` | STRING | Yes | N/A | The text lists to be merged. Multiple lists can be connected to the input, and they will be concatenated into one. |

**Note:** This node is configured as a group process (`is_group_process = True`), meaning it automatically handles multiple list inputs by concatenating them before the main processing function runs.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `texts` | STRING | The single, merged list containing all the input texts. |
