This node removes the background from a video using the Bria AI service. It processes the input video and replaces the original background with a solid color of your choice. The operation is performed via an external API, and the result is returned as a new video file.

## Inputs

|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `video` | VIDEO | Yes | N/A | The input video file from which the background will be removed. |
| `background_color` | STRING | Yes | `"Black"`<br />`"White"`<br />`"Gray"`<br />`"Red"`<br />`"Green"`<br />`"Blue"`<br />`"Yellow"`<br />`"Cyan"`<br />`"Magenta"`<br />`"Orange"` | The solid color to use as the new background for the output video. |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 2147483647 | A seed value that controls whether the node should re-run. The results are non-deterministic regardless of the seed value. (default: 0) |

**Note:** The input video must have a duration of 60 seconds or less.
