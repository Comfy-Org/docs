This node generates videos using the Kling V3 model. It supports two primary modes: text-to-video, where a video is created from a text description, and image-to-video, where an existing image is animated. It also offers advanced features like creating multi-segment videos with different prompts for each part (storyboards) and optionally generating accompanying audio.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `multi_shot` | COMBO | Yes | `"disabled"`<br />`"1 storyboard"`<br />`"2 storyboards"`<br />`"3 storyboards"`<br />`"4 storyboards"`<br />`"5 storyboards"`<br />`"6 storyboards"` | Controls whether to generate a single video or a series of segments with individual prompts and durations. When not "disabled," additional inputs for each storyboard's prompt and duration appear. |
| `generate_audio` | BOOLEAN | Yes | `True` / `False` | When enabled, the node will generate audio for the video. Default is `True`. |
| `model` | COMBO | Yes | `"kling-v3"` | The model and its associated settings. Selecting this option reveals the `resolution` and `aspect_ratio` sub-parameters. |
| `model.resolution` | COMBO | Yes | `"1080p"`<br />`"720p"` | The resolution for the generated video. This setting is available when the `model` is set to "kling-v3". |
| `model.aspect_ratio` | COMBO | Yes | `"16:9"`<br />`"9:16"`<br />`"1:1"` | The aspect ratio for the generated video. This setting is ignored when an image is provided for `start_frame` (image-to-video mode). Available when the `model` is set to "kling-v3". |
| `seed` | INT | Yes | 0 to 2147483647 | A seed value for generation. Changing this value will cause the node to re-run, but the results are non-deterministic. Default is `0`. |
| `start_frame` | IMAGE | No | - | An optional starting image. When connected, the node switches from text-to-video to image-to-video mode, animating the provided image. |

**Inputs for `multi_shot` mode:**

* When `multi_shot` is set to **"disabled"**, the following inputs appear:
  * `prompt` (STRING): The main text description for the video. Required. Must be between 1 and 2500 characters.
  * `negative_prompt` (STRING): Text describing what should not appear in the video. Optional.
  * `duration` (INT): The length of the video in seconds. Must be between 3 and 15. Default is `5`.
* When `multi_shot` is set to a storyboard option (e.g., `"3 storyboards"`), inputs for each storyboard segment appear (e.g., `storyboard_1_prompt`, `storyboard_1_duration`). Each prompt must be between 1 and 512 characters. The **total sum of all storyboard durations** must be between 3 and 15 seconds.

**Constraints:**

* The node operates in **text-to-video** mode when `start_frame` is not connected. It uses the `model.aspect_ratio` setting in this mode.
* The node operates in **image-to-video** mode when `start_frame` is connected. The `model.aspect_ratio` setting is ignored. The input image must be at least 300x300 pixels and have an aspect ratio between 1:2.5 and 2.5:1.
* In storyboard mode (`multi_shot` not "disabled"), the main `prompt` and `negative_prompt` inputs are hidden and not used.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `video` | VIDEO | The generated video file. |
