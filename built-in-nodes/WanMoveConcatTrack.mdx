The WanMoveConcatTrack node combines two sets of motion tracking data into a single, longer sequence. It works by joining the track paths and visibility masks from the input tracks along their respective dimensions. If only one track input is provided, it simply passes that data through unchanged.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `tracks_1` | TRACKS | Yes | | The first set of motion tracking data to be concatenated. |
| `tracks_2` | TRACKS | No | | An optional second set of motion tracking data. If not provided, `tracks_1` is passed directly to the output. |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `tracks` | TRACKS | The concatenated motion tracking data, containing the combined `track_path` and `track_visibility` from the inputs. |
