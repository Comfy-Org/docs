This node loads an encoded training dataset that has been previously saved to disk. It searches for and reads all data shard files from a specified folder within the ComfyUI output directory, then returns the combined latent vectors and conditioning data for use in training workflows.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `folder_name` | STRING | No | N/A | Name of the folder containing the saved dataset, located inside the ComfyUI output directory (default: "training_dataset"). |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `latents` | LATENT | A list of latent dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a `"samples"` key with a tensor. |
| `conditioning` | CONDITIONING | A list of conditioning lists, where each inner list contains conditioning data for a corresponding sample. |
