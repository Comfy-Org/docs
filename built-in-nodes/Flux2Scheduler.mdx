The Flux2Scheduler node generates a sequence of noise levels (sigmas) for the denoising process, specifically tailored for the Flux model. It calculates a schedule based on the number of denoising steps and the dimensions of the target image, which influences the progression of noise removal during image generation.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `steps` | INT | Yes | 1 to 4096 | The number of denoising steps to perform. A higher value typically leads to more detailed results but takes longer to process (default: 20). |
| `width` | INT | Yes | 16 to 16384 | The width of the image to be generated, in pixels. This value influences the noise schedule calculation (default: 1024). |
| `height` | INT | Yes | 16 to 16384 | The height of the image to be generated, in pixels. This value influences the noise schedule calculation (default: 1024). |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `sigmas` | SIGMAS | A sequence of noise level values (sigmas) that define the denoising schedule for the sampler. |
