The Resize Images by Longer Edge node resizes one or more images so that their longest side matches a specified target length. It automatically determines whether the width or height is longer and scales the other dimension proportionally to preserve the original aspect ratio. This is useful for standardizing image sizes based on their largest dimension.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The input image or batch of images to be resized. |
| `longer_edge` | INT | No | 1 - 8192 | Target length for the longer edge. The shorter edge will be scaled proportionally. (default: 1024) |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | The resized image or batch of images. The output will have the same number of images as the input, with each one's longer edge matching the specified `longer_edge` length. |
