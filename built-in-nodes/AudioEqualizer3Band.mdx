The Audio Equalizer (3-Band) node allows you to adjust the bass, mid, and treble frequencies of an audio waveform. It applies three separate filters: a low shelf for bass, a peaking filter for mids, and a high shelf for treble. Each band can be independently controlled with gain, frequency, and bandwidth settings.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `audio` | AUDIO | Yes | - | The input audio data containing the waveform and sample rate. |
| `low_gain_dB` | FLOAT | No | -24.0 to 24.0 | Gain for Low frequencies (Bass). Positive values boost, negative values cut. (default: 0.0) |
| `low_freq` | INT | No | 20 to 500 | Cutoff frequency for Low shelf filter in Hertz (Hz). (default: 100) |
| `mid_gain_dB` | FLOAT | No | -24.0 to 24.0 | Gain for Mid frequencies. Positive values boost, negative values cut. (default: 0.0) |
| `mid_freq` | INT | No | 200 to 4000 | Center frequency for the Mid peaking filter in Hertz (Hz). (default: 1000) |
| `mid_q` | FLOAT | No | 0.1 to 10.0 | Q factor (bandwidth) for the Mid peaking filter. Lower values create a wider band, higher values create a narrower band. (default: 0.707) |
| `high_gain_dB` | FLOAT | No | -24.0 to 24.0 | Gain for High frequencies (Treble). Positive values boost, negative values cut. (default: 0.0) |
| `high_freq` | INT | No | 1000 to 15000 | Cutoff frequency for High shelf filter in Hertz (Hz). (default: 5000) |

**Note:** The `low_gain_dB`, `mid_gain_dB`, and `high_gain_dB` parameters are only applied when their value is not zero. If a gain is set to 0.0, the corresponding filter stage is skipped.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `audio` | AUDIO | The processed audio data with the equalization applied, containing the modified waveform and the original sample rate. |
