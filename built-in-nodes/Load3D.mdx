The Load3D node is a core node for loading and processing 3D model files. When loading the node, it automatically retrieves available 3D resources from `ComfyUI/input/3d/`. You can also upload supported 3D files for preview using the upload function.

**Supported Formats**
Currently, this node supports multiple 3D file formats, including `.gltf`, `.glb`, `.obj`, `.fbx`, and `.stl`.

**3D Node Preferences**
Some related preferences for 3D nodes can be configured in ComfyUI's settings menu. Please refer to the following documentation for corresponding settings:

[Settings Menu - 3D](/interface/settings/3d)

Besides regular node outputs, Load3D has lots of 3D view-related settings in the canvas menu.

## Canvas Area Description

The Load3D node's Canvas area contains numerous view operations, including:
- Preview view settings (grid, background color, preview view)
- Camera control: Control FOV, camera type
- Global illumination intensity: Adjust lighting intensity
- Video recording: Record and export videos
- Model export: Supports `GLB`, `OBJ`, `STL` formats
- And more

![Load 3D Node UI](/images/comfy_core/load3d/load3d_ui.jpg)

1. Contains multiple menus and hidden menus of the Load 3D node
2. Menu for `resizing preview window` and `canvas video recording`
3. 3D view operation axis
4. Preview thumbnail
5. Preview size settings, scale preview view display by setting dimensions and then resizing window

### 1. View Operations

View control operations:
- Left-click + drag: Rotate the view
- Right-click + drag: Pan the view
- Middle wheel scroll or middle-click + drag: Zoom in/out
- Coordinate axis: Switch views

### 2. Left Menu Functions

![Menu](/images/comfy_core/load3d/menu.jpg)

In the canvas, some settings are hidden in the menu. Click the menu button to expand different menus
- 1. Scene: Contains preview window grid, background color, preview settings
- 2. Model: Model rendering mode, texture materials, up direction settings
- 3. Camera: Switch between orthographic and perspective views, and set the perspective angle size
- 4. Light: Scene global illumination intensity
- 5. Export: Export model to other formats (GLB, OBJ, STL)

#### Scene

![scene menu](/images/comfy_core/load3d/menu_scene.jpg)

The Scene menu provides some basic scene setting functions
1. Show/Hide grid
2. Set background color
3. Click to upload a background image
4. Hide the preview

#### Model

![Menu_Scene](/images/comfy_core/load3d/menu_model.jpg)

The Model menu provides some model-related functions
1. **Up direction**: Determine which axis is the up direction for the model
2. **Material mode**: Switch model rendering modes - Original, Normal, Wireframe, Lineart

#### Camera

![menu_modelmenu_camera](/images/comfy_core/load3d/menu_camera.jpg)

This menu provides switching between orthographic and perspective views, and perspective angle size settings
1. **Camera**: Quickly switch between orthographic and orthographic views
2. **FOV**: Adjust FOV angle

#### Light

![menu_modelmenu_camera](/images/comfy_core/load3d/menu_light.jpg)

Through this menu, you can quickly adjust the scene's global illumination intensity

#### Export

![menu_export](/images/comfy_core/load3d/menu_export.jpg)

This menu provides the ability to quickly convert and export model formats

### 3. Right Menu Functions

The right menu has two main functions:
1. **Reset view ratio**: After clicking the button, the view will adjust the canvas rendering area ratio according to the set width and height
2. **Video recording**: Allows you to record current 3D view operations as video, allows import, and can be output as `recording_video` to subsequent nodes
