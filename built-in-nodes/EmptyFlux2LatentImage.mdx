The EmptyFlux2LatentImage node creates a blank, empty latent representation. It generates a tensor filled with zeros, which serves as a starting point for the Flux model's denoising process. The dimensions of the latent are determined by the input width and height, scaled down by a factor of 16.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `width` | INT | Yes | 16 to 8192 | The width of the final image to generate. The latent width will be this value divided by 16. The default value is 1024. |
| `height` | INT | Yes | 16 to 8192 | The height of the final image to generate. The latent height will be this value divided by 16. The default value is 1024. |
| `batch_size` | INT | No | 1 to 4096 | The number of latent samples to generate in a single batch. The default value is 1. |

**Note:** The `width` and `height` inputs must be divisible by 16, as the node internally divides them by this factor to create the latent dimensions.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `samples` | LATENT | A latent tensor filled with zeros. The shape is `[batch_size, 128, height // 16, width // 16]`. |
