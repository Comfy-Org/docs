The MaskPreview node generates a visual preview of a mask by converting it into a 3-channel image format and saving it as a temporary file. It takes a mask input and reshapes it into a format suitable for image display, then saves the result to the temporary directory with a random filename prefix. This allows users to visually inspect mask data during workflow execution.
