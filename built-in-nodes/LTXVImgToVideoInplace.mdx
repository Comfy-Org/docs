The LTXVImgToVideoInplace node conditions a video latent representation by encoding an input image into its initial frames. It works by using a VAE to encode the image into the latent space and then blending it with the existing latent samples based on a specified strength. This allows an image to serve as a starting point or conditioning signal for video generation.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `vae` | VAE | Yes | - | The VAE model used to encode the input image into the latent space. |
| `image` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The input image to be encoded and used to condition the video latent. |
| `latent` | LATENT | Yes | - | The target latent video representation to be modified. |
| `strength` | FLOAT | No | 0.0 - 1.0 | Controls the blending strength of the encoded image into the latent. A value of 1.0 fully replaces the initial frames, while lower values blend them. (default: 1.0) |
| `bypass` | BOOLEAN | No | - | Bypass the conditioning. When enabled, the node returns the input latent unchanged. (default: False) |

**Note:** The `image` will be automatically resized to match the spatial dimensions required by the `vae` for encoding, based on the `latent` input's width and height.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `latent` | LATENT | The modified latent video representation. It contains the updated samples and a `noise_mask` that applies the conditioning strength to the initial frames. |
