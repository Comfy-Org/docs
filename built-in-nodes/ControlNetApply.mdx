Using controlNet requires preprocessing of input images. Since ComfyUI initial nodes do not come with preprocessors and controlNet models, please first install ControlNet preprocessors [download preprocessors here](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfy_controlnet_preprocessors) and corresponding controlNet models.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `positive` | `CONDITIONING` | Positive conditioning data, from CLIP Text Encoder or other conditioning inputs |
| `negative` | `CONDITIONING` | Negative conditioning data, from CLIP Text Encoder or other conditioning inputs |
| `control_net` | `CONTROL_NET` | The controlNet model to apply, typically input from ControlNet Loader |
| `image` | `IMAGE` | Image for controlNet application, needs to be processed by preprocessor |
| `vae` | `VAE` | Vae model input |
| `strength` | `FLOAT` | Controls the strength of network adjustments, value range 0~10. Recommended values between 0.5~1.5 are reasonable. Lower values allow more model freedom, higher values impose stricter constraints. Too high values may result in strange images. You can test and adjust this value to fine-tune the control network's influence. |
| `start_percent` | `FLOAT` | Value 0.000~1.000, determines when to start applying controlNet as a percentage, e.g., 0.2 means ControlNet guidance will start influencing image generation at 20% of the diffusion process |
| `end_percent` | `FLOAT` | Value 0.000~1.000, determines when to stop applying controlNet as a percentage, e.g., 0.8 means ControlNet guidance will stop influencing image generation at 80% of the diffusion process |

### Outputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `positive` | `CONDITIONING` | Positive conditioning data processed by ControlNet, can be output to next ControlNet or K Sampler nodes |
| `negative` | `CONDITIONING` | Negative conditioning data processed by ControlNet, can be output to next ControlNet or K Sampler nodes |
