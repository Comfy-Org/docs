The ZImageFunControlnet node applies a specialized control network to influence the image generation or editing process. It uses a base model, a model patch, and a VAE, allowing you to adjust the strength of the control effect. This node can work with a base image, an inpainting image, and a mask for more targeted edits.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | Yes | - | The base model used for the generation process. |
| `model_patch` | MODEL_PATCH | Yes | - | A specialized patch model that applies the control network's guidance. |
| `vae` | VAE | Yes | - | The Variational Autoencoder used for encoding and decoding images. |
| `strength` | FLOAT | Yes | -10.0 to 10.0 | The strength of the control network's influence. Positive values apply the effect, while negative values can invert it (default: 1.0). |
| `image` | IMAGE | No | - | An optional base image to guide the generation process. |
| `inpaint_image` | IMAGE | No | - | An optional image used specifically for inpainting areas defined by a mask. |
| `mask` | MASK | No | - | An optional mask that defines which areas of an image should be edited or inpainted. |

**Note:** The `inpaint_image` parameter is typically used in conjunction with a `mask` to specify the content for inpainting. The node's behavior may change based on which optional inputs are provided (e.g., using `image` for guidance or using `image`, `mask`, and `inpaint_image` for inpainting).

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | The model with the control network patch applied, ready for use in a sampling pipeline. |
| `positive` | CONDITIONING | The positive conditioning, potentially modified by the control network inputs. |
| `negative` | CONDITIONING | The negative conditioning, potentially modified by the control network inputs. |
