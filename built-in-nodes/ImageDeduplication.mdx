This node removes duplicate or very similar images from a batch. It works by creating a perceptual hash for each image—a simple numerical fingerprint based on its visual content—and then comparing them. Images whose hashes are more similar than a set threshold are considered duplicates and filtered out.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The batch of images to process for deduplication. |
| `similarity_threshold` | FLOAT | No | 0.0 - 1.0 | Similarity threshold (0-1). Higher means more similar. Images above this threshold are considered duplicates. (default: 0.95) |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | The filtered list of images with duplicates removed. |
