The LTXVLatentUpsampler node increases the spatial resolution of a video latent representation by a factor of two. It uses a specialized upscale model to process the latent data, which is first un-normalized and then re-normalized using the provided VAE's channel statistics. This node is designed for video workflows within the latent space.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `samples` | LATENT | Yes | | The input latent representation of the video to be upscaled. |
| `upscale_model` | LATENT_UPSCALE_MODEL | Yes | | The loaded model used to perform the 2x upscaling on the latent data. |
| `vae` | VAE | Yes | | The VAE model used to un-normalize the input latents before upscaling and to normalize the output latents afterwards. |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `LATENT` | LATENT | The upscaled latent representation, with spatial dimensions doubled compared to the input. |
