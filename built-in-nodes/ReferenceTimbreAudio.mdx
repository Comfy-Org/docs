This node sets a reference audio timbre for use in the "ace step 1.5" process. It works by taking a conditioning input and optionally a latent representation of audio, then attaches that latent data to the conditioning for use by subsequent nodes in the workflow.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `conditioning` | CONDITIONING | Yes | | The conditioning data to which the reference audio information will be attached. |
| `latent` | LATENT | No | | An optional latent representation of the reference audio. When provided, its samples are added to the conditioning. |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `conditioning` | CONDITIONING | The modified conditioning data, now containing the reference audio timbre latents if the optional `latent` input was provided. |
