The `Context Windows (Manual)` node helps you process ultra-long content. It decomposes long sequences into multiple overlapping context windows for sampling, rather than processing the entire sequence at once, thereby saving memory and enabling high-quality results generation.

**How it works:**
Like using multiple segmented samples to generate different segments of a video, and finally synthesizing a complete video**
- Each window looks at a part (window processing)
- Windows overlap to ensure coherence (overlap areas)
- Finally, all parts are spliced into a complete image (result fusion)

## Input Parameters

| Parameter Name | Function | Simple Explanation |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|
| `model` | Model Input | The model you want to process |
| `context_length` | Window Size | Length of each small window, the larger the range the more memory it occupies |
| `context_overlap` | Overlap Size | Overlapping part between windows, more overlap means smoother effect but slower processing |
| `context_schedule` | Processing Method | Choose how windows move, four modes available |
| `context_stride` | Movement Step | How much the window moves each time, only useful in uniform mode |
| `closed_loop` | Loop Mode | Whether to connect the last window back to the first, only useful in loop mode |
| `fuse_method` | Merge Method | Choose how overlapping parts merge, affects final effect |
| `dim` | Processing Dimension | Which direction to process, usually 0 (time direction) |

## Scheduling Strategy Selection

| Scheduling Strategy | Working Method |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **STATIC_STANDARD** | Window positions are fixed |
| **UNIFORM_STANDARD** | Windows move uniformly |
| **UNIFORM_LOOPED** | Windows move in a loop |
| **BATCHED** | Multiple windows processed simultaneously |

## Merge Methods

| Merge Method | Weight Distribution Method | Characteristics |
|-------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **PYRAMID** | Middle part most important, decreasing toward edges | Most natural effect, recommended |
| **RELATIVE** | Intelligent weight adjustment | Automatically adjusts based on position, natural effect |
| **FLAT** | Average weight distribution | Simple and direct, suitable for uniform content |
| **OVERLAP_LINEAR** | Linear gradient | Smoother transition |

## Output Results

| Parameter Name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `model` | Processed model, can be directly connected to sampler for use |
