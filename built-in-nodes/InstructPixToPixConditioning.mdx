The InstructPixToPixConditioning node prepares conditioning data for InstructPix2Pix image editing by combining positive and negative text prompts with image data. It processes input images through a VAE encoder to create latent representations and attaches these latents to both positive and negative conditioning data. The node automatically handles image dimensions by cropping to multiples of 8 pixels for compatibility with the VAE encoding process.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `positive` | CONDITIONING | Yes | - | Positive conditioning data containing text prompts and settings for desired image characteristics |
| `negative` | CONDITIONING | Yes | - | Negative conditioning data containing text prompts and settings for undesired image characteristics |
| `vae` | VAE | Yes | - | VAE model used for encoding input images into latent representations |
| `pixels` | IMAGE | Yes | - | Input image to be processed and encoded into latent space |

**Note:** The input image dimensions are automatically adjusted by cropping to the nearest multiple of 8 pixels in both width and height to ensure compatibility with the VAE encoding process.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `positive` | CONDITIONING | Positive conditioning data with attached latent image representation |
| `negative` | CONDITIONING | Negative conditioning data with attached latent image representation |
| `latent` | LATENT | Empty latent tensor with the same dimensions as the encoded image |
