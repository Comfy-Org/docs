The Mahiro node modifies the guidance function to focus more on the direction of the positive prompt rather than the difference between positive and negative prompts. It creates a patched model that applies a custom guidance scaling approach using cosine similarity between normalized conditional and unconditional denoised outputs. This experimental node helps steer the generation more strongly toward the positive prompt's intended direction.
