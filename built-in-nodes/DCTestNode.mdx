The DCTestNode is a logic node that returns different types of data based on a user's selection from a dynamic combo box. It acts as a conditional router, where the chosen option determines which input field is active and what type of value the node will output.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `combo` | COMBO | Yes | `"option1"`<br />`"option2"`<br />`"option3"`<br />`"option4"` | The main selection that determines which input field is active and what the node will output. |
| `string` | STRING | No | - | A text input field. This field is only active and required when `combo` is set to `"option1"`. |
| `integer` | INT | No | - | A whole number input field. This field is only active and required when `combo` is set to `"option2"`. |
| `image` | IMAGE | No | - | An image input field. This field is only active and required when `combo` is set to `"option3"`. |
| `subcombo` | COMBO | No | `"opt1"`<br />`"opt2"` | A secondary selection that appears when `combo` is set to `"option4"`. It determines which nested input fields are active. |
| `float_x` | FLOAT | No | - | A decimal number input. This field is only active and required when `combo` is set to `"option4"` and `subcombo` is set to `"opt1"`. |
| `float_y` | FLOAT | No | - | A decimal number input. This field is only active and required when `combo` is set to `"option4"` and `subcombo` is set to `"opt1"`. |
| `mask1` | MASK | No | - | A mask input field. This field is only active when `combo` is set to `"option4"` and `subcombo` is set to `"opt2"`. It is optional. |

**Parameter Constraints:**

* The `combo` parameter controls the visibility and requirement of all other input fields. Only the inputs associated with the selected `combo` option will be shown and are required (except for `mask1` which is optional).
* When `combo` is set to `"option4"`, the `subcombo` parameter becomes required and controls a second set of nested inputs (`float_x`/`float_y` or `mask1`).

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | ANYTYPE | The output depends on the selected `combo` option. It can be a STRING (`"option1"`), an INT (`"option2"`), an IMAGE (`"option3"`), or a string representation of the `subcombo` dictionary (`"option4"`). |
