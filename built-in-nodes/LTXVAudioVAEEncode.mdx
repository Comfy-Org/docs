The LTXV Audio VAE Encode node takes an audio input and compresses it into a smaller, latent representation using a specified Audio VAE model. This process is essential for generating or manipulating audio within a latent space workflow, as it converts raw audio data into a format that other nodes in the pipeline can understand and process.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `audio` | AUDIO | Yes | - | The audio to be encoded. |
| `audio_vae` | VAE | Yes | - | The Audio VAE model to use for encoding. |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `Audio Latent` | LATENT | The compressed latent representation of the input audio. The output includes the latent samples, the sample rate of the VAE model, and a type identifier. |
