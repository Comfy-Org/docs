This node uses the Kling 3.0 model to generate a video. It creates the video based on a text prompt, a specified duration, and two provided images: a starting frame and an ending frame. The node can also generate accompanying audio for the video.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `prompt` | STRING | Yes | N/A | The text description that guides the video generation. Must be between 1 and 2500 characters long. |
| `duration` | INT | No | 3 to 15 | The length of the video in seconds (default: 5). |
| `first_frame` | IMAGE | Yes | N/A | The starting image for the video. Must be at least 300x300 pixels and have an aspect ratio between 1:2.5 and 2.5:1. |
| `end_frame` | IMAGE | Yes | N/A | The ending image for the video. Must be at least 300x300 pixels and have an aspect ratio between 1:2.5 and 2.5:1. |
| `generate_audio` | BOOLEAN | No | N/A | Controls whether to generate audio for the video (default: True). |
| `model` | COMBO | No | `"kling-v3"` | Model and generation settings. Selecting this option reveals a nested `resolution` parameter. |
| `model.resolution` | COMBO | No | `"1080p"`<br />`"720p"` | The resolution for the generated video. This parameter is only available when the `model` is set to `"kling-v3"`. |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 2147483647 | A number used to control whether the node should re-run. The results are non-deterministic regardless of the seed value (default: 0). |

**Note:** The `first_frame` and `end_frame` images must meet the specified minimum size and aspect ratio requirements for the node to function correctly.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | VIDEO | The generated video file. |
