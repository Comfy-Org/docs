The Magnific Image Upscale (Precise V2) node performs high-fidelity image upscaling with precise control over sharpness, grain, and detail enhancement. It processes images through an external API, supporting up to a maximum output resolution of 10060×10060 pixels. The node offers different processing styles and can automatically downscale the input if the requested output would exceed the maximum allowed size.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The input image to be upscaled. Exactly one image is required. Minimum dimensions are 160x160 pixels. The aspect ratio must be between 1:3 and 3:1. |
| `scale_factor` | STRING | Yes | `"2x"`<br />`"4x"`<br />`"8x"`<br />`"16x"` | The desired upscaling multiplier. |
| `flavor` | STRING | Yes | `"sublime"`<br />`"photo"`<br />`"photo_denoiser"` | The processing style. "sublime" is for general use, "photo" is optimized for photographs, and "photo_denoiser" is for noisy photos. |
| `sharpen` | INT | No | 0 to 100 | Controls the intensity of image sharpening to increase edge definition and clarity. Higher values produce a sharper result. Default: 7. |
| `smart_grain` | INT | No | 0 to 100 | Adds intelligent grain or texture enhancement to prevent the upscaled image from looking too smooth or artificial. Default: 7. |
| `ultra_detail` | INT | No | 0 to 100 | Controls the amount of fine detail, textures, and micro-details added during the upscaling process. Default: 30. |
| `auto_downscale` | BOOLEAN | No | - | When enabled, the node will automatically downscale the input image if the calculated output dimensions would exceed the maximum allowed resolution of 10060x10060 pixels. This helps prevent errors but may affect quality. Default: False. |

**Note:** If `auto_downscale` is disabled and the requested output size (input dimensions × `scale_factor`) exceeds 10060x10060 pixels, the node will raise an error.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | The resulting upscaled image. |
