Kling Text to Video Camera Control Node transforms text into cinematic videos with professional camera movements that simulate real-world cinematography. This node supports controlling virtual camera actions including zoom, rotation, pan, tilt, and first-person view while maintaining focus on your original text. The duration, mode, and model name are hard-coded because camera control is only supported in pro mode with the kling-v1-5 model at 5-second duration.
