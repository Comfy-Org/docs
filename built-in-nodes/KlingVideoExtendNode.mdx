The Kling Video Extend Node allows you to extend videos created by other Kling nodes. It takes an existing video identified by its video ID and generates additional content based on your text prompts. The node works by sending your extension request to the Kling API and returning the extended video along with its new ID and duration.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `prompt` | STRING | No | - | Positive text prompt for guiding the video extension |
| `negative_prompt` | STRING | No | - | Negative text prompt for elements to avoid in the extended video |
| `cfg_scale` | FLOAT | No | 0.0 - 1.0 | Controls the strength of prompt guidance (default: 0.5) |
| `video_id` | STRING | Yes | - | The ID of the video to be extended. Supports videos generated by text-to-video, image-to-video, and previous video extension operations. Cannot exceed 3 minutes total duration after extension. |

**Note:** The `video_id` must reference a video created by other Kling nodes, and the total duration after extension cannot exceed 3 minutes.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | VIDEO | The extended video generated by the Kling API |
| `video_id` | STRING | The unique identifier for the extended video |
| `duration` | STRING | The duration of the extended video |
