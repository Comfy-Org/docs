The UNETLoader node is designed for loading U-Net models by name, facilitating the use of pre-trained U-Net architectures within the system.

This node will detect models located in the `ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models` folder.

## Inputs

| Parameter   | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| `unet_name` | COMBO[STRING] | Specifies the name of the U-Net model to be loaded. This name is used to locate the model within a predefined directory structure, enabling the dynamic loading of different U-Net models. |
| `weight_dtype` | ... | 🚧  fp8_e4m3fn fp9_e5m2  |

## Outputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `model`   | MODEL     | Returns the loaded U-Net model, allowing it to be utilized for further processing or inference within the system. |
