This node creates a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) hook that applies only to the model component, allowing you to modify model behavior without affecting the CLIP component. It loads a LoRA file and applies it with a specified strength to the model while keeping the CLIP component unchanged. The node can be chained with previous hooks to create complex modification pipelines.
