The PairConditioningCombine node combines two pairs of conditioning data (positive and negative) into a single pair. It takes two separate conditioning pairs as input and merges them using ComfyUI's internal conditioning combination logic. This node is experimental and primarily used for advanced conditioning manipulation workflows.
