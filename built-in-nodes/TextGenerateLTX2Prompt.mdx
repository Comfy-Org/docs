The TextGenerateLTX2Prompt node is a specialized version of a text generation node. It takes a user's text prompt and automatically formats it with specific system instructions before sending it to a language model for enhancement or completion. The node can operate in two modes: text-only or with an image reference, using different system prompts for each case.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `clip` | CLIP | Yes | | The CLIP model used for text encoding. |
| `prompt` | STRING | Yes | | The raw text input from the user that will be enhanced or completed. |
| `max_length` | INT | Yes | | The maximum number of tokens the language model is allowed to generate. |
| `sampling_mode` | COMBO | Yes | `"greedy"`<br />`"top_k"`<br />`"top_p"`<br />`"temperature"` | The sampling strategy used to select the next token during text generation. |
| `image` | IMAGE | No | | An optional input image. When provided, the node uses a different system prompt that includes a placeholder for image context. |

**Note:** The behavior of the node changes based on the presence of the `image` input. If an image is provided, the generated prompt will be formatted for an image-to-video task. If no image is provided, the formatting will be for a text-to-video task.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | STRING | The enhanced or completed text string generated by the language model. |
