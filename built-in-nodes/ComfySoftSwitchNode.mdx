The Soft Switch node selects between two possible input values based on a boolean condition. It outputs the value from the `on_true` input when the `switch` is true, and the value from the `on_false` input when the `switch` is false. This node is designed to be lazy, meaning it only evaluates the input that is needed based on the switch state.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `switch` | BOOLEAN | Yes | | The boolean condition that determines which input to pass through. When true, the `on_true` input is selected. When false, the `on_false` input is selected. |
| `on_false` | MATCH_TYPE | No | | The value to output when the `switch` condition is false. This input is optional, but at least one of `on_false` or `on_true` must be connected. |
| `on_true` | MATCH_TYPE | No | | The value to output when the `switch` condition is true. This input is optional, but at least one of `on_false` or `on_true` must be connected. |

**Note:** The `on_false` and `on_true` inputs must be of the same data type, as defined by the node's internal template. At least one of these two inputs must be connected for the node to function.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | MATCH_TYPE | The selected value. It will match the data type of the connected `on_false` or `on_true` input. |
