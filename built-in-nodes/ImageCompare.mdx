The Image Compare node provides a visual interface to compare two images side-by-side using a draggable slider. It is designed as an output node, meaning it does not pass data to other nodes but instead displays the images directly in the user interface for inspection.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `image_a` | IMAGE | No | - | The first image to compare. |
| `image_b` | IMAGE | No | - | The second image to compare. |
| `compare_view` | IMAGECOMPARE | Yes | - | The control that enables the slider comparison view in the UI. |

**Note:** This node is an output node. While `image_a` and `image_b` are optional, at least one image must be provided for the node to have a visible effect. The node will display an empty area for any image input that is not connected.

## Outputs

This node is an output node and does not produce any data outputs for use in other nodes. Its function is to display the provided images in the ComfyUI interface.
