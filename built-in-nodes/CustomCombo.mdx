The Custom Combo node allows you to create a custom dropdown menu with your own list of text options. It is a frontend-focused node that provides a backend representation to ensure compatibility within your workflow. When you select an option from the dropdown, the node outputs that text as a string.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `choice` | COMBO | Yes | User-defined | The text option selected from the custom dropdown. The list of available options is defined by the user in the node's frontend interface. |

**Note:** The validation for this node's input is intentionally disabled. This allows you to define any custom text options you want in the frontend without the backend checking if your selection is from a predefined list.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | STRING | The text string of the option selected from the custom combo box. |
