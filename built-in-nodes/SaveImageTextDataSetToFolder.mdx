The Save Image and Text Dataset to Folder node saves a list of images and their corresponding text captions to a specified folder within ComfyUI's output directory. For each image saved as a PNG file, a matching text file with the same base name is created to store its caption. This is useful for creating organized datasets of generated images and their descriptions.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | Yes | - | List of images to save. |
| `texts` | STRING | Yes | - | List of text captions to save. |
| `folder_name` | STRING | No | - | Name of the folder to save images to (inside output directory). (default: "dataset") |
| `filename_prefix` | STRING | No | - | Prefix for saved image filenames. (default: "image") |

**Note:** The `images` and `texts` inputs are lists. The node expects the number of text captions to match the number of images provided. Each caption will be saved in a `.txt` file corresponding to its paired image.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| - | - | This node does not have any outputs. It saves files directly to the filesystem. |
