The `BasicScheduler` node is designed to compute a sequence of sigma values for diffusion models based on the provided scheduler, model, and denoising parameters. It dynamically adjusts the total number of steps based on the denoise factor to fine-tune the diffusion process, providing precise "recipes" for different stages in advanced sampling processes that require fine control (such as multi-stage sampling).

### Scheduler Types

Based on source code `comfy.samplers.SCHEDULER_NAMES`, supports the following 9 schedulers:

## Node Role: Artist's Color Mixing Assistant

Imagine you are an artist creating a clear image from a chaotic mixture of paint (noise). `BasicScheduler` acts like your **professional color mixing assistant**, whose job is to prepare a series of precise paint concentration recipes:

### Workflow

- **Step 1**: Use 90% concentration paint (high noise level)
- **Step 2**: Use 80% concentration paint  
- **Step 3**: Use 70% concentration paint
- **...**
- **Final Step**: Use 0% concentration (clean canvas, no noise)

### Color Assistant's Special Skills

**Different mixing methods (scheduler)**:

- **"karras" mixing method**: Paint concentration changes very smoothly, like professional artist's gradient technique
- **"exponential" mixing method**: Paint concentration decreases rapidly, suitable for quick creation
- **"linear" mixing method**: Paint concentration decreases uniformly, stable and controllable

**Fine control (steps)**:

- **20 mixes**: Quick painting, efficiency priority
- **50 mixes**: Fine painting, quality priority

**Creation intensity (denoise)**:

- **1.0 = Complete new creation**: Start completely from blank canvas
- **0.5 = Half transformation**: Keep half of original painting, transform half
- **0.2 = Fine adjustment**: Only make subtle adjustments to original painting
