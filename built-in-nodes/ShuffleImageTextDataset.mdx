This node shuffles a list of images and a list of texts together, keeping their pairings intact. It uses a random seed to determine the shuffle order, ensuring the same input lists will be shuffled in the same way each time the seed is reused.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | Yes | - | List of images to shuffle. |
| `texts` | STRING | Yes | - | List of texts to shuffle. |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 18446744073709551615 | Random seed. The shuffle order is determined by this value (default: 0). |

**Note:** The `images` and `texts` inputs must be lists of the same length. The node will pair the first image with the first text, the second image with the second text, and so on, before shuffling these pairs together.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | The shuffled list of images. |
| `texts` | STRING | The shuffled list of texts, maintaining their original pairings with the images. |
