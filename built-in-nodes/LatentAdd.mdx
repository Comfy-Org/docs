The LatentAdd node is designed for the addition of two latent representations. It facilitates the combination of features or characteristics encoded in these representations by performing element-wise addition.

## Inputs

| Parameter    | Data Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| `samples1`   | `LATENT`    | The first set of latent samples to be added. It represents one of the inputs whose features are to be combined with another set of latent samples. |
| `samples2`   | `LATENT`    | The second set of latent samples to be added. It serves as the other input whose features are combined with the first set of latent samples through element-wise addition. |

## Outputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `latent`  | `LATENT`    | The result of the element-wise addition of two latent samples, representing a new set of latent samples that combines the features of both inputs. |
