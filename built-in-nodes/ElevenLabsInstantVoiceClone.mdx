The ElevenLabs Instant Voice Clone node creates a new, unique voice model by analyzing 1 to 8 audio recordings of a person's voice. It sends these samples to the ElevenLabs API, which processes them to generate a voice clone that can be used for text-to-speech synthesis.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `audio_*` | AUDIO | Yes | 1 to 8 files | Audio recordings for voice cloning. You must provide between 1 and 8 audio files. |
| `remove_background_noise` | BOOLEAN | No | True / False | Remove background noise from voice samples using audio isolation. (default: False) |

**Note:** You must provide at least one audio file, and you can provide up to eight. The node will automatically create input slots for the audio files you add.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `voice` | ELEVENLABS_VOICE | The unique identifier for the newly created cloned voice model. This output can be connected to other ElevenLabs text-to-speech nodes. |
