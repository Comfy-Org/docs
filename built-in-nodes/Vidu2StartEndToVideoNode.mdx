This node generates a video by interpolating between a provided start frame and an end frame, guided by a text prompt. It uses a specified Vidu model to create a smooth transition between the two images over a set duration.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model` | COMBO | Yes | `"viduq2-pro-fast"`<br />`"viduq2-pro"`<br />`"viduq2-turbo"` | The Vidu model to use for video generation. |
| `first_frame` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The starting image for the video sequence. Only a single image is allowed. |
| `end_frame` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The ending image for the video sequence. Only a single image is allowed. |
| `prompt` | STRING | Yes | - | A text description guiding the video generation (maximum 2000 characters). |
| `duration` | INT | No | 2 to 8 | The length of the generated video in seconds (default: 5). |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 2147483647 | A number used to initialize the random generation for reproducible results (default: 1). |
| `resolution` | COMBO | No | `"720p"`<br />`"1080p"` | The output resolution of the generated video. |
| `movement_amplitude` | COMBO | No | `"auto"`<br />`"small"`<br />`"medium"`<br />`"large"` | The movement amplitude of objects in the frame. |

**Note:** The `first_frame` and `end_frame` images must have similar aspect ratios. The node will validate that their aspect ratios are within a relative range of 0.8 to 1.25.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | VIDEO | The generated video file. |
