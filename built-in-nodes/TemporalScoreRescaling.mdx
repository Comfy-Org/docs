This node applies Temporal Score Rescaling (TSR) to a diffusion model. It modifies the model's sampling behavior by rescaling the predicted noise or score during the denoising process, which can steer the diversity of the generated output. This is implemented as a post-CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) function.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | Yes | - | The diffusion model to be patched with the TSR function. |
| `tsr_k` | FLOAT | No | 0.01 - 100.0 | Controls the rescaling strength. Lower k produces more detailed results; higher k produces smoother results in image generation. Setting k = 1 disables rescaling. (default: 0.95) |
| `tsr_sigma` | FLOAT | No | 0.01 - 100.0 | Controls how early rescaling takes effect. Larger values take effect earlier. (default: 1.0) |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `patched_model` | MODEL | The input model, now patched with the Temporal Score Rescaling function applied to its sampling process. |
