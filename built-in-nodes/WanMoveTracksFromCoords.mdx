The WanMoveTracksFromCoords node creates a set of motion tracks from a list of coordinate points. It converts a JSON-formatted string of coordinates into a tensor format that can be used by other video processing nodes, and can optionally apply a mask to control the visibility of tracks over time.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `track_coords` | STRING | Yes | N/A | A JSON-formatted string containing the coordinate data for the tracks. The default value is an empty list (`"[]"`). |
| `track_mask` | MASK | No | N/A | An optional mask. When provided, the node uses it to determine the visibility of each track per frame. |

**Note:** The `track_coords` input expects a specific JSON structure. It should be a list of tracks, where each track is a list of frames, and each frame is an object with `x` and `y` coordinates. The number of frames must be consistent across all tracks.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `tracks` | TRACKS | The generated track data, containing the path coordinates and visibility information for each track. |
| `track_length` | INT | The total number of frames in the generated tracks. |
