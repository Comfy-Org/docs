This node uses the Kling AI model to generate a video. It requires a starting image and a text prompt. You can optionally provide an ending image or up to six reference images to guide the video's content and style. The node processes these inputs to create a video of a specified duration and resolution.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model_name` | COMBO | Yes | `"kling-video-o1"` | The specific Kling AI model to use for video generation. |
| `prompt` | STRING | Yes | - | A text prompt describing the video content. This can include both positive and negative descriptions. |
| `duration` | INT | Yes | 3 to 10 | The desired length of the generated video in seconds (default: 5). |
| `first_frame` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The starting image for the video sequence. |
| `end_frame` | IMAGE | No | - | An optional end frame for the video. This cannot be used simultaneously with `reference_images`. |
| `reference_images` | IMAGE | No | - | Up to 6 additional reference images. |
| `resolution` | COMBO | No | `"1080p"`<br />`"720p"` | The output resolution for the generated video (default: "1080p"). |

**Important Constraints:**

* The `end_frame` input cannot be used at the same time as the `reference_images` input.
* If you do not provide an `end_frame` or any `reference_images`, the `duration` can only be set to 5 or 10 seconds.
* All input images (`first_frame`, `end_frame`, and any `reference_images`) must have a minimum dimension of 300 pixels in both width and height.
* The aspect ratio of all input images must be between 1:2.5 and 2.5:1.
* A maximum of 6 images can be provided via the `reference_images` input.
* The `prompt` text must be between 1 and 2500 characters in length.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `output` | VIDEO | The generated video file. |
