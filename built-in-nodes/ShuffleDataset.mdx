The Shuffle Dataset node takes a list of images and randomly changes their order. It uses a seed value to control the randomness, ensuring the same shuffle order can be reproduced. This is useful for randomizing the sequence of images in a dataset before processing.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The list of images to be shuffled. |
| `seed` | INT | No | 0 to 18446744073709551615 | Random seed. A value of 0 will produce a different shuffle each time. (default: 0) |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | The same list of images, but in a new, randomly shuffled order. |
