The WanMoveVisualizeTracks node overlays motion tracking data onto a sequence of images or video frames. It draws visual representations of tracked points, including their movement paths and current positions, making the motion data visible and easier to analyze.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The sequence of input images or video frames to visualize the tracks on. |
| `tracks` | TRACKS | No | - | The motion tracking data containing point paths and visibility information. If not provided, the input images are passed through unchanged. |
| `line_resolution` | INT | Yes | 1 - 1024 | The number of previous frames to use when drawing the trailing path line for each track (default: 24). |
| `circle_size` | INT | Yes | 1 - 128 | The size of the circle drawn at the current position of each track (default: 12). |
| `opacity` | FLOAT | Yes | 0.0 - 1.0 | The opacity of the drawn track overlays (default: 0.75). |
| `line_width` | INT | Yes | 1 - 128 | The width of the lines used to draw the track paths (default: 16). |

**Note:** If the number of input images does not match the number of frames in the provided `tracks` data, the image sequence will be repeated to match the track length.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `IMAGE` | IMAGE | The sequence of images with the motion tracking data visualized as overlays. If no `tracks` were provided, the original input images are returned. |
