The Merge Image Lists node combines multiple separate lists of images into a single, continuous list. It works by taking all the images from each connected input and appending them together in the order they are received. This is useful for organizing or batching images from different sources for further processing.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | Yes | - | A list of images to be merged. This input can accept multiple connections, and each connected list will be concatenated into the final output. |

**Note:** This node is designed to receive multiple inputs. You can connect several image lists to the single `images` input socket. The node will automatically concatenate all images from all connected lists into one output list.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | The single, merged list containing all images from every connected input list. |
