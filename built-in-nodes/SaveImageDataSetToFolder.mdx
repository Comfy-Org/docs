This node saves a list of images to a specified folder within ComfyUI's output directory. It takes multiple images as input and writes them to disk with a customizable filename prefix.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `images` | IMAGE | Yes | N/A | List of images to save. |
| `folder_name` | STRING | No | N/A | Name of the folder to save images to (inside output directory). The default value is "dataset". |
| `filename_prefix` | STRING | No | N/A | Prefix for saved image filenames. The default value is "image". |

**Note:** The `images` input is a list, meaning it can receive and process multiple images at once. The `folder_name` and `filename_prefix` parameters are scalar values; if a list is connected, only the first value from that list will be used.

## Outputs

This node does not have any outputs. It is an output node that performs a save operation to the filesystem.
