The LTXVConcatAVLatent node combines a video latent representation and an audio latent representation into a single, concatenated latent output. It merges the `samples` tensors from both inputs and, if present, their `noise_mask` tensors as well, preparing them for further processing in a video generation pipeline.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `video_latent` | LATENT | Yes | | The latent representation of the video data. |
| `audio_latent` | LATENT | Yes | | The latent representation of the audio data. |

**Note:** The `samples` tensors from the `video_latent` and `audio_latent` inputs are concatenated. If either input contains a `noise_mask`, it will be used; if one is missing, a mask of ones (same shape as the corresponding `samples`) is created for it. The resulting masks are then also concatenated.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `latent` | LATENT | A single latent dictionary containing the concatenated `samples` and, if applicable, the concatenated `noise_mask` from the video and audio inputs. |
