The Join Audio Channels node combines two separate mono audio inputs into a single stereo audio output. It takes a left channel and a right channel, ensures they have compatible sample rates and lengths, and merges them into a two-channel audio waveform.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `audio_left` | AUDIO | Yes | | The mono audio data to be used as the left channel in the resulting stereo audio. |
| `audio_right` | AUDIO | Yes | | The mono audio data to be used as the right channel in the resulting stereo audio. |

**Note:** Both input audio streams must be mono (single-channel). If they have different sample rates, the channel with the lower rate will be automatically resampled to match the higher rate. If the audio streams have different lengths, they will be trimmed to the length of the shorter one.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `audio` | AUDIO | The resulting stereo audio, containing the joined left and right channels. |
