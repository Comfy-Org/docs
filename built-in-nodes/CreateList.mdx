The Create List node combines multiple inputs into a single, sequential list. It takes any number of inputs of the same data type and concatenates them in the order they are connected. This node is useful for preparing batches of data, such as images or text, to be processed by other nodes in a workflow.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `input_*` | Varies | Yes | Any | A variable number of input slots. You can add more inputs by clicking the plus (+) icon. All inputs must be of the same data type (e.g., all IMAGE or all STRING). |

**Note:** The node will automatically create new input slots as you connect items. All connected inputs must share the same data type for the node to function correctly.

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `list` | Varies | A single list containing all the items from the connected inputs, concatenated in the order they were provided. The output data type matches the input data type. |
