The Adjust Brightness node modifies the brightness of an input image. It works by multiplying each pixel's value by a specified factor, then ensuring the resulting values stay within a valid range. A factor of 1.0 leaves the image unchanged, values below 1.0 make it darker, and values above 1.0 make it brighter.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | Yes | - | The input image to adjust. |
| `factor` | FLOAT | No | 0.0 - 2.0 | Brightness factor. 1.0 = no change, <1.0 = darker, >1.0 = brighter. (default: 1.0) |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `image` | IMAGE | The output image with adjusted brightness. |
