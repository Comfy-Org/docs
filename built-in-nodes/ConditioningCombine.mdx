This node combines two conditioning inputs into a single output, effectively merging their information. The two conditions are combined using list concatenation.

## Inputs

| Parameter Name       | Data Type          | Description |
|----------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| `conditioning_1`     | `CONDITIONING`     | The first conditioning input to be combined. It has equal importance with `conditioning_2` in the combination process. |
| `conditioning_2`     | `CONDITIONING`     | The second conditioning input to be combined. It has equal importance with `conditioning_1` in the combination process. |

## Outputs

| Parameter Name       | Data Type          | Description |
|----------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| `conditioning`       | `CONDITIONING`     | The result of combining `conditioning_1` and `conditioning_2`, encapsulating the merged information. |

## Usage Scenarios

Compare the two groups below: the left side uses the ConditioningCombine node, while the right side shows normal output.

In this example, the two conditions used in `Conditioning Combine` have equivalent importance. Therefore, you can use different text encodings for image style, subject features, etc., allowing the prompt features to be output more completely. The second prompt uses the combined complete prompt, but semantic understanding may encode completely different conditions.

Using this node, you can achieve:

- Basic text merging: Connect the outputs of two `CLIP Text Encode` nodes to the two input ports of `Conditioning Combine`
- Complex prompt combination: Combine positive and negative prompts, or separately encode main descriptions and style descriptions before merging
- Conditional chain combination: Multiple `Conditioning Combine` nodes can be used in series to achieve gradual combination of multiple conditions
