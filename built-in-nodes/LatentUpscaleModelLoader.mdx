The LatentUpscaleModelLoader node loads a specialized model designed for upscaling latent representations. It reads a model file from the system's designated folder and automatically detects its type (720p, 1080p, or other) to instantiate and configure the correct internal model architecture. The loaded model is then ready to be used by other nodes for latent space super-resolution tasks.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model_name` | STRING | Yes | *All files in the `latent_upscale_models` folder* | The name of the latent upscale model file to load. The available options are dynamically populated from the files present in your ComfyUI's `latent_upscale_models` directory. |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `model` | LATENT_UPSCALE_MODEL | The loaded latent upscale model, configured and ready for use. |
