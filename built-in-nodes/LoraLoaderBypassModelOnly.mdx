This node applies a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to a model to modify its behavior, but only affects the model component itself. It loads a specified LoRA file and adjusts the model's weights by a given strength, leaving other components like the CLIP text encoder unchanged.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | Yes | - | The base model to which the LoRA adjustments will be applied. |
| `lora_name` | STRING | Yes | (List of available LoRA files) | The name of the LoRA file to load and apply. The options are populated from the files in the `loras` directory. |
| `strength_model` | FLOAT | Yes | -100.0 to 100.0 | The strength of the LoRA's effect on the model's weights. A positive value applies the LoRA, a negative value applies the inverse, and a value of 0 has no effect (default: 1.0). |

## Outputs

| Output Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `model` | MODEL | The modified model with the LoRA adjustments applied to its weights. |
