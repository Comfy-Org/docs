This node is designed to adjust the temporal aspect of conditioning by setting a specific range of timesteps. It allows for the precise control over the start and end points of the conditioning process, enabling more targeted and efficient generation.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONDITIONING` | CONDITIONING | The conditioning input represents the current state of the generation process, which this node modifies by setting a specific range of timesteps. |
| `start` | `FLOAT` | The start parameter specifies the beginning of the timestep range as a percentage of the total generation process, allowing for fine-tuned control over when the conditioning effects begin. |
| `end` | `FLOAT` | The end parameter defines the endpoint of the timestep range as a percentage, enabling precise control over the duration and conclusion of the conditioning effects. |

## Outputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONDITIONING` | CONDITIONING | The output is the modified conditioning with the specified timestep range applied, ready for further processing or generation. |
