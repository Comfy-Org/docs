The Kling Omni Edit Video (Pro) node uses an AI model to edit an existing video based on a text description. You provide a source video and a prompt, and the node generates a new video of the same length with the requested changes. It can optionally use reference images to guide the style and keep the original audio from the source video.

## Inputs

| Parameter | Data Type | Required | Range | Description |

| `model_name` | COMBO | Yes | `"kling-video-o1"` | The AI model to use for video editing. |
| `prompt` | STRING | Yes | | A text prompt describing the video content. This can include both positive and negative descriptions. |
| `video` | VIDEO | Yes | | Video for editing. The output video length will be the same. |
| `keep_original_sound` | BOOLEAN | Yes | | Determines if the original audio from the input video is kept in the output (default: True). |

**Constraints and Limitations:**

* The `prompt` must be between 1 and 2500 characters long.
