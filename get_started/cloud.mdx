Comfy Cloud provides a hosted solution for running ComfyUI workflows without requiring local installation or GPU hardware. This guide will help you get started with Comfy Cloud.

## What is Comfy Cloud?

Comfy Cloud is a cloud-based platform that allows you to:

- Run ComfyUI workflows without local installation
- Access powerful GPU resources on-demand
- Share and collaborate on workflows
- Scale your AI generation workloads

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Comfy Cloud, you'll need:

- A Comfy account (create one at [platform.comfy.org](https://platform.comfy.org))
- Credits for cloud compute (see [Credits](/interface/credits) for more information)

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an Account

Visit [platform.comfy.org](https://platform.comfy.org) and create an account using:

- Email
- Google
- GitHub

### 2. Access Comfy Cloud

Once logged in, you can access Comfy Cloud through:

- The web interface at [platform.comfy.org](https://platform.comfy.org)
- ComfyUI Desktop with cloud integration
- API access using your API key

### 3. Load a Workflow

You can start with:

- Pre-built workflow templates
- Your own custom workflows
- Community-shared workflows

### 4. Configure Cloud Resources

Select the appropriate GPU tier for your workflow:

- **Basic**: For simple workflows and testing
- **Standard**: For most production workflows
- **Premium**: For complex, high-resolution generations

### 5. Run Your Workflow

Click **Queue** to submit your workflow to the cloud. Your job will be:

1. Queued for processing
2. Assigned to available GPU resources
3. Executed in the cloud
4. Results returned to your account

## Cloud vs Local

| Feature | Comfy Cloud | Local Installation |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Setup | No installation required | Requires setup and configuration |
| GPU | Access to high-end GPUs | Limited by your hardware |
| Storage | Cloud storage included | Uses local disk space |
| Scaling | Automatic scaling | Limited by local resources |
| Cost | Pay per use | One-time hardware cost |

## Managing Credits

Comfy Cloud uses a credit-based system:

- Credits are consumed based on compute time and resources used
- Purchase credits through your account dashboard
- Monitor usage in real-time
- Set spending limits to control costs

For detailed information about credits and pricing, see [Credits Management](/interface/credits).

## API Access

You can integrate Comfy Cloud into your applications using the API:

1. Generate an API key from your account settings
2. Use the API to submit workflows programmatically
3. Monitor job status and retrieve results

See [Account Management](/interface/user) for details on creating and managing API keys.
