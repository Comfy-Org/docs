Comfy Cloud provides a hosted solution for running ComfyUI workflows without requiring local installation or GPU hardware.

## Account and login

To use Comfy Cloud, you'll need a Comfy account. Visit [cloud.comfy.org](https://cloud.comfy.org) and log in with your Comfy account credentials. Once logged in, you can start using ComfyUI immediately.

## What is Comfy Cloud?

ComfyUI Cloud is the cloud version of ComfyUI with the same features as the local ComfyUI version. It's designed to just work - you don't have to install any models or custom nodes. Everything is pre-installed, so all you need to do is open [cloud.comfy.org](https://cloud.comfy.org) and everything is ready to go. You can access it anywhere from any device with an internet connection.

## Managing your workflows

### Check workflow status

Click the Queue icon on the left sidebar to open the panel and see the status of all workflows.

### Save your outputs

Right now, Cloud doesn't support accessing all your outputs if they are out of the queue history length. (This will be supported in later updates). Save the outputs manually to avoid losing them.

### Increase queue history size

1. Click on the logo to open the dropdown menu
2. Click on Settings to open the settings panel
3. Search for `history` setting
4. Increase the `Queue history size`

## Cloud vs local

| Feature | Comfy Cloud | Local ComfyUI |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Setup** | No installation required - ready to use immediately | Requires Python environment setup and configuration |
| **GPU requirements** | Access to powerful server GPUs | Requires your own GPU hardware |
| **Models & nodes** | Pre-installed popular models and custom nodes | Manual installation and management required |
| **Updates** | Always up-to-date with latest releases | Manual updates and troubleshooting needed |
| **Dependencies** | No dependency conflicts | Potential version mismatches and package conflicts |
| **Maintenance** | Zero maintenance overhead | Ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting |
| **Cost** | Subscription-based | Free (hardware costs separate) |
| **Access** | Use online from any device | Limited to devices with local installation |
| **Feature parity** | Same features as local version | Same features as cloud version |

Both versions will always have the same features. We're equally committed to developing both. ComfyUI will always be free to run locally, and the open source ComfyUI and the cloud version will always have feature parity. Cloud is the way we will make revenue and sustain the long-term development of ComfyUI.

## Current limitations

### Limited custom models & nodes

We currently have limited support for models and custom nodes, but we're working to support more in the future.
