## Cloud vs local

| Category | Comfy Cloud | Self-hosted (local ComfyUI) |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Cost** | Monthly Subscription | Free |
| **GPU** | Powerful A100s with 40GB+ VRAM | Bring your own GPU |
| **Technical Knowledge** | No technical knowledge required. | While desktop and portable give you easy ways to get started, you'll need to troubleshoot custom node installations and local installation issues. |
| **Custom Nodes** | Use pre-installed custom nodes and never worry about compatibility issues. | Install any custom node you want, but you'll need to manage it yourself. |
| **Models** | Use pre-installed models. Upload your own models (coming soon). | Use any models you want, but you'll need to download them first. |
| **Notable Differences** | Easy to onboard your team | Works offline, infinitely customizable |
| **Get started** | [Run ComfyUI Cloud](https://comfy.org/cloud) | [Install ComfyUI locally](/installation/system_requirements) |

Both versions will always have the same features. We're equally committed to developing both. ComfyUI will always be free to run locally, and the open source ComfyUI and the cloud version will always have feature parity. Cloud is the way we will make revenue and sustain the long-term development of ComfyUI.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update template inputs">
    1. In the loaded workflow, since we have pre-installed all models in the cloud version, all templates are ready to run immediately after loading.
    2. If you need to make updates, you only need to provide image inputs or text prompts. Check the `Load Image` node or `CLIP Text Encode` node.
