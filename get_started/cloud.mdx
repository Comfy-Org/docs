Comfy Cloud provides a hosted solution for running ComfyUI workflows without requiring local installation or GPU hardware. This guide will help you get started with Comfy Cloud.

## What is Comfy Cloud?

Comfy Cloud is a cloud-based platform that allows you to:

- Run ComfyUI workflows without local installation
- Access powerful GPU resources on-demand
- Use pre-installed models and custom nodes
- Focus on creating without setup hassles

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with Comfy Cloud, you'll need:

- A Comfy account (create one at [www.comfy.org/cloud](https://www.comfy.org/cloud))
- Access to the private beta (join the waitlist if you haven't been granted access yet)

## Getting started

### 1. Join the private beta

Comfy Cloud is currently in private beta testing. We're gradually granting access based on submissions. Please submit to join our waitlist.

### 2. Access Comfy Cloud

Once you have access permission, open your web browser and visit [www.comfy.org/cloud](https://www.comfy.org/cloud), then log in with your Comfy account. You can start using it right away.

### 3. Using templates

Using Comfy Cloud is exactly the same as local ComfyUI. If you're new to ComfyUI, here are some quick tips:

#### a. Click the templates icon on the left sidebar

#### b. Click on any template you want to run

The highlighted five workflows are specially designed for cloud users and include:

- **Text to Image**: Generate images from text prompts
- **Image Editing**: Edit images through text prompts, such as "change hair color"
- **Image to Video**: Turn any of your images into a 5-second video
- **Image to 3D**: Turn any of your images into a 3D model
- **Text to Song**: AI-generated song based on your text prompts

#### c. Provide your inputs

Since all the models in the template are ready, you only need to provide image input or a prompt. Check the `Load Image` node or `CLIP Text Encode` node to provide your inputs.

#### d. Run the workflow

If everything is loaded correctly, click the "Run" icon or use the shortcut "Ctrl + Enter" to run the workflow.

### 4. Simplified workflows

If the workflow still seems too complex for you, here are some simplified ready-to-use workflows. You can download them and drag them into Comfy Cloud to use right away.

## Managing your workflows

### Check workflow status

Click the Queue icon on the left sidebar to open the panel and see the status of all workflows.

### Save your outputs

Right now, Cloud doesn't support accessing all your outputs if they are out of the queue history length. (This will be supported in later updates). Save the outputs manually to avoid losing them during beta testing.

### Increase queue history size

1. Click on the logo to open the dropdown menu
2. Click on Settings to open the settings panel
3. Search for `history` setting
4. Increase the `Queue history size`

## Cloud vs local

The main difference is how you access ComfyUI:

- **Open Source ComfyUI**: Install and run on your own devices
- **Comfy Cloud**: Use online with zero-setup hassle

Both versions will always have the same features. We're equally committed to developing both. The only difference is that Comfy Cloud runs on our powerful servers, so you don't need a powerful GPU on your computer.

ComfyUI will always be free to run locally, and the open source ComfyUI and the cloud version will always have feature parity. Cloud is the way we will make revenue and sustain the long-term development of ComfyUI.

## Common challenges solved by Comfy Cloud

Local ComfyUI installation often faces these challenges:

- **Environment setup issues**: Complex Python environment configuration
- **Dependency conflicts**: Version mismatches and package conflicts
- **Hardware limitations**: No powerful enough GPUs limiting what you can do
- **Maintenance overhead**: Constant updates and troubleshooting

With Comfy Cloud, you don't need to worry about any of these issues. It's ready to use right away with popular models and custom nodes already pre-installed, giving you the powerful GPU and models you need while allowing you to focus on creating, not solving conflicts.

## Current limitations

### Limited custom models & nodes

We currently have limited support for models and custom nodes, but we're working to support more in the future.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I access Comfy Cloud?">
    Currently, the product is still in beta testing. We'll gradually open up the permissions. Only users on the whitelist will be invited. If approved, we'll send an email notification.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I upload my own models?">
    Not for now. This will be supported soon.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I install custom nodes?">
    Currently, users can't install custom nodes by themselves on Comfy Cloud, but we'll gradually expand support for more custom nodes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the cloud test version have manager?">
    The cloud test version doesn't support users to install custom plugins, so there are no manager-related functions. We'll add support for plugins later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I check the status of my running workflows?">
    You can check the workflow execution status in the queue panel. Since workflows are executed concurrently across the platform, there may be some latency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I check the execution history?">
    Due to the limitations of the cloud version, you can only view it in the queue history, with a maximum of 256 entries. Beta testers are advised to save the content manually.
