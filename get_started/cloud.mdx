## Cloud vs local

| Category | Comfy Cloud | Self-hosted (local ComfyUI) |
|----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Cost** | Monthly Subscription | Free |
| **GPU** | Powerful A100s with 40GB+ VRAM | Bring your own GPU |
| **Technical Knowledge** | No technical knowledge required. | While desktop and portable give you easy ways to get started, you'll need to troubleshoot custom node installations and local installation issues. |
| **Custom Nodes** | Use pre-installed custom nodes and never worry about compatibility issues. | Install any custom node you want, but you'll need to manage it yourself. |
| **Models** | Use pre-installed models. Upload your own models (coming soon). | Use any models you want, but you'll need to download them first. |
| **Notable Differences** | Easy to onboard your team | Works offline, infinitely customizable |
| **Get started** | [Run ComfyUI Cloud](https://comfy.org/cloud) | [Install ComfyUI locally](/installation/system_requirements) |

Both versions will always have the same features. We're equally committed to developing both. ComfyUI will always be free to run locally, and the open source ComfyUI and the cloud version will always have feature parity. Cloud is the way we will make revenue and sustain the long-term development of ComfyUI.

## Account and login

To use Comfy Cloud, you'll need a Comfy account. Visit [cloud.comfy.org](https://cloud.comfy.org) and log in with your Comfy account credentials. Once logged in, you can start using ComfyUI immediately.

## Managing your workflows

### Check workflow status

Click the Queue icon on the left sidebar to open the panel and see the status of all workflows.

### Save your outputs

Right now, Cloud doesn't support accessing all your outputs if they are out of the queue history length. (This will be supported in later updates). Save the outputs manually to avoid losing them.

### Increase queue history size

1. Click on the logo to open the dropdown menu
2. Click on Settings to open the settings panel
3. Search for `history` setting
4. Increase the `Queue history size`

## Current limitations

### Limited custom models & nodes

We currently have limited support for models and custom nodes, but we're working to support more in the future.
