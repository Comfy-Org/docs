**ComfyUI Desktop** is a standalone installation version that supports one-click installation and automatic configuration of **Python environment and dependencies**. It supports importing existing ComfyUI settings, models, workflows and files, allowing quick migration from existing [ComfyUI Portable](/en/get_started/comfyui_portable_windows) to the desktop version.

ComfyUI Desktop is an open source project, please visit the full code: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop

ComfyUI Desktop hardware requirements:
- NVIDIA GPU

System Requirements:
- Please install [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above

Double-click the corresponding shortcut to enter ComfyUI initialization settings

### Display unsupported devices

![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Unsupported Device](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-0.jpg)

Since ComfyUI Desktop (Windows) only supports **NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA**, you may see this screen if your device is not supported
- Please switch to a supported device
- Or consider using [ComfyUI Portable](/en/get_started/comfyui_portable_windows) to use ComfyUI

### Normal ComfyUI Desktop Initialization Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Screen">
   ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Start](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-1.jpg)

   Click **Get Started** to begin initialization
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select GPU">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - GPU Selection](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-2.jpg)

   The three options are:
   1. **Nvidia GPU (Recommended):** Direct support for pytorch and CUDA
   2. **Manual Configuration:** You need to manually install and configure the python runtime environment. Don't select this unless you know how to configure
   3. **Enable CPU Mode:** For developers and special cases only. Don't select this unless you're sure you need it
    
    Unless there are special circumstances, please select **NVIDIA** as shown and click **Next** to proceed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install location">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Installation Location](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-3.jpg)

  In this step you will select the installation location for ComfyUI related content such as:
  - **Python environment**
  - **Models files**
  - **Custom Nodes**
  It is recommended to choose an SSD and create a separate empty folder as the ComfyUI installation directory. Click **Next** to continue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate from Existing Installation (Optional)">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - File Migration](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-4.jpg)

  In this step you can migrate your existing ComfyUI installation content to ComfyUI Desktop. As shown, I selected my original **D:\ComfyUI_windows_portable\ComfyUI** installation directory. The installer will automatically recognize:
  - **User Files**
  - **Models:** Will not be copied, only linked with desktop version
  - **Custom Nodes:** Nodes will be reinstalled

  Don't worry, this step won't copy model files. You can check or uncheck options as needed. Click **Next** to continue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Desktop Settings">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Desktop Settings](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-5.jpg)

   These are preference settings:
   1. **Automatic Updates:** Whether to set automatic updates when ComfyUI updates are available
   2. **Usage Metrics:** If enabled, we will collect **anonymous usage data** to help improve ComfyUI
   3. **Mirror Settings:** Since the program needs internet access to download Python and complete environment installation, if you see a red ‚ùå during installation indicating this may cause installation failure, please follow the steps below

   ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Mirror Settings](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-6.jpg)
   Expand the mirror settings to find the specific failing mirror. In this screenshot the error is **Python Install Mirror** failure.

   You can use either of these methods to resolve mirror link errors:
   1. Find available mirror sources and update mirrors
   2. Make sure [Python 3.12 +] (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above is installed

  </Step>
  <Step title="Desktop Setting">
  If everything is correct, the installer will complete and automatically enter the ComfyUI Desktop interface
  </Step>
</Steps>
