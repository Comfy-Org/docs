**ComfyUI Desktop** is a standalone installation version that supports one-click installation and automatic configuration of **Python environment and dependencies**. It supports importing existing ComfyUI settings, models, workflows and files, allowing quick migration from existing [ComfyUI Portable](/en/get_started/comfyui_portable_windows) to the desktop version.

ComfyUI Desktop hardware requirements:
- NVIDIA GPU

- ComfyUI Desktop source: https://github.com/Comfy-Org/desktop

This tutorial will guide you through the software installation process and explain related configuration details.

<Warning>As **ComfyUI Desktop** is still in **Beta** status, the actual installation process may change</Warning>

Double-click the corresponding shortcut to enter ComfyUI initialization settings

### Unsupported Devices 

![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Unsupported Device](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-0.jpg)

Since ComfyUI Desktop (Windows) only supports **NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA**, you may see this screen if your device is not supported
- Please switch to a supported device
- Or consider using [ComfyUI Portable](/en/get_started/comfyui_portable_windows) to use ComfyUI

### Normal ComfyUI Desktop Initialization Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Screen">
   ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Start](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-1.jpg)

   Click **Get Started** to begin initialization
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select GPU">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - GPU Selection](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-2.jpg)

   The three options are:
   1. Nvidia GPU (Recommended): Direct support for pytorch and CUDA
   2. Manual Configuration: You need to manually install and configure the python runtime environment. Don't select this unless you know how to configure
   3. Enable CPU Mode: For developers and special cases only. Don't select this unless you're sure you need it
    
    Unless there are special circumstances, please select **NVIDIA** as shown and click **Next** to proceed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install location">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Installation Location](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-3.jpg)

  In this step you will select the installation location for ComfyUI related content such as:
  - Python environment
  - Models files
  - Custom Nodes
  It is recommended to choose an SSD and create a separate empty folder as the ComfyUI installation directory. Click **Next** to continue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Migrate from Existing Installation (Optional)">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - File Migration](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-4.jpg)

  In this step you can migrate your existing ComfyUI installation content to ComfyUI Desktop. As shown, I selected my original **D:\ComfyUI_windows_portable** installation directory. The installer will automatically recognize:
  - User Files
  - Models: Will not be copied, only linked with desktop version
  - Custom Nodes: Nodes will be reinstalled

  Don't worry, this step won't copy model files. You can check or uncheck options as needed. Click **Next** to continue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Desktop Settings">
  ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Desktop Settings](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-5.jpg)

   These are preference settings:
   1. Automatic Updates: Whether to set automatic updates when ComfyUI updates are available
   2. Usage Metrics: If enabled, we will collect **anonymous usage data** to help improve ComfyUI
   3. Mirror Settings: Since the program needs internet access to download Python and complete environment installation, if you see a red ‚ùå during installation indicating this may cause installation failure, please follow the steps below

   ![ComfyUI Installation Steps - Mirror Settings](/images/desktop/win-comfyui-desktop-6.jpg)
   Expand the mirror settings to find the specific failing mirror. In this screenshot the error is **Python Install Mirror** failure.

   You can use either of these methods to resolve mirror link errors:
   1. Find available mirror sources and update mirrors
   2. Manually download corresponding mirror files and use path names to directly read files for installation

   As shown above, download needed mirror files locally and use `file:///C:/Users/YourName/Downloads/package.tar.gz` to let installer read dependency files
  </Step>
  <Step title="Desktop Setting">
  If everything is correct, the installer will complete and automatically enter the ComfyUI Desktop interface
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How to Find Causes of ComfyUI Desktop Installation Failures
If installation fails, you should see the following screen
