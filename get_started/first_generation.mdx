This guide aims to help you understand ComfyUI's basic operations and complete your first image generation. We'll cover:

1. Loading example workflows
    - Loading from ComfyUI's workflow templates
    - Loading from images with workflow metadata
2. Model installation guidance
    - Automatic model installation
    - Manual model installation
    - Using ComfyUI Manager for model installation
3. Completing your first text-to-image generation

## About Text-to-Image

Text-to-Image is a fundamental AI drawing feature that generates images from text descriptions. It's one of the most commonly used functions in AI art generation. You can think of the process as telling your requirements (positive and negative prompts) to an artist (the drawing model), who will then create what you want. Detailed explanations about text-to-image will be covered in the [Text to Image](/tutorials/basic/text-to-image) chapter.

## ComfyUI Text-to-Image Workflow Tutorial

### 1. Launch ComfyUI

Make sure you've followed the [installation guide](/installation/system_requirements) to start ComfyUI and can successfully enter the ComfyUI interface. Alternatively, you can use [Comfy Cloud](/get_started/cloud) to use ComfyUI without any installation.

If you have not installed ComfyUI, please choose a suitable version to install based on your device.

### 2. Load Default Text-to-Image Workflow

ComfyUI usually loads the default text-to-image workflow automatically when launched. However, you can try different methods to load workflows to familiarize yourself with ComfyUI's basic operations:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Load from Workflow Template">
  ![ComfyUI Interface](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-1.jpg)
  Follow the numbered steps in the image:
  1. Click the **Fit View** button in the bottom right to ensure any loaded workflow isn't hidden
  2. Click the **folder icon (workflows)** in the sidebar
  3. Click the **Browse example workflows** button at the top of the Workflows panel

  Continue with:
  ![Load Workflow](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-2-load-workflow.jpg)

  4. Select the first default workflow **Image Generation** to load it

  Alternatively, you can select **Browse workflow templates** from the workflow menu
  ![ComfyUI Menu - Browse Workflow Templates](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-1-menu.jpg)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Load from Images with Metadata">
  All images generated by ComfyUI contain metadata including workflow information. You can load workflows by:
  - Dragging and dropping a ComfyUI-generated image into the interface
  - Using menu **Workflows** -> **Open** to open an image

  Try loading the workflow using this example image:
  ![ComfyUI-Text to Image Workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comfy-Org/example_workflows/refs/heads/main/text-to-image-workflow.png)

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Load from workflow.json">
  ComfyUI workflows can be stored in JSON format. You can export workflows using menu **Workflows** -> **Export**.

  Try downloading and loading this example workflow:
  <a className="prose" href="https://github.com/Comfy-Org/docs/blob/main/public/text-to-image.json" download style={{ display: 'inline-block', backgroundColor: '#0078D6', color: '#ffffff', padding: '10px 20px', borderRadius: '8px', borderColor: "transparent", textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>
    <p className="prose" style={{ margin: 0, fontSize: "0.8rem" }}>Download text-to-image.json</p>
  </a>

  After downloading, use menu **Workflows** -> **Open** to load the JSON file.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Model Installation

Most ComfyUI installations don't include base models by default. After loading the workflow, if you don't have the [v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/stable-diffusion-v1-5-archive/blob/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors) model installed, you'll see this prompt:

![Missing Models](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-3-missing-models.jpg)

All models are stored in `<your ComfyUI installation>/ComfyUI/models/` with subfolders like `checkpoints`, `embeddings`, `vae`, `lora`, `upscale_model`, etc. ComfyUI detects models in these folders and paths configured in `extra_model_paths.yaml` at startup.

![ComfyUI Models Folder](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-models-folder.jpg)

You can install models through:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automatic Download">
  After you click the **Download** button, ComfyUI will execute the download, and different behaviors will be performed depending on the version you are using.
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="ComfyUI Desktop">

    The desktop version will automatically complete the model download and save it to the `<your ComfyUI installation location>/ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` directory.
    You can wait for the installation to complete or view the installation progress in the model panel on the sidebar.

    ![Model Download Progress](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-download-status.jpg)

    If everything goes smoothly, the model should be able to download locally. If the download fails for a long time, please try other installation methods.

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="ComfyUI Portable">

    The browser will execute file downloads. Please save the file to the `<your ComfyUI installation location>/ComfyUI_windows_portable/ComfyUI/models/checkpoints` directory after the download is complete.
    
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="ComfyUI Manager">
  ComfyUI Manager is a tool for managing custom nodes, models, and plugins.

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Open ComfyUI Manager">
      ![ComfyUI Manager Installation](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-comfyui-manager.jpg)
      
      Click the `Manager` button to open ComfyUI Manager
    </Step>
    <Step title="Open Model Manager">
      ![ComfyUI Manager Model Management](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-comfyui-manager-model-manager.jpg)
      
      Click `Model Manager`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Search and Install Model">
      ![ComfyUI Manager Model Download](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-4-comfyui-manager-download-model.jpg)
      
      1. Search for `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt`
      2. Click `install` on the desired model
    </Step>
  </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual Installation">
  Visit [v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/stable-diffusion-v1-5-archive/blob/main/v1-5-pruned-emaonly-fp16.safetensors) and follow this guide:

  ![Hugging Face Model Download](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-5-hugging-face.jpg)

  Save the downloaded file to:

  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="ComfyUI Desktop">
      Save to `<your ComfyUI installation>/ComfyUI/models/checkpoints`

      ![ComfyUI Desktop Model Save Location](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-6-2-desktop.jpg)

### 4. Load Model and Generate Your First Image

After installing the model:

![Image Generation](/images/tutorial/gettingstarted/first-image-generation-7-queue.jpg)

2. Click `Queue` or press `Ctrl + Enter` to generate

The result will appear in the **Save Image** node. Right-click to save locally.
