## Getting started

### Join the beta

Comfy Cloud is currently in private beta. You can join the waitlist at [cloud.comfy.org](https://cloud.comfy.org).

Beta participants receive:

- Free access during the beta period
- Opportunity to provide feedback that shapes the product
- Early access to new features

### Future pricing

After the beta period, Comfy Cloud will use a subscription model based on GPU usage. You will only be charged for the time your workflows are actively running on the GPU, not for the time spent building workflows when the GPU is idle.

## Comfy Cloud vs local installation

| Feature | Comfy Cloud | Local Installation |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Setup required | None | Manual installation |
| GPU needed | No (uses cloud GPUs) | Yes (for good performance) |
| Model management | Pre-configured | Manual download and setup |
| Updates | Automatic | Manual updates |

## Commitment to open source

ComfyUI will always remain free and open source. Comfy Cloud is the revenue model that sustains long-term development of the open source project.

Key commitments:

- The open source version will always be free to run locally
