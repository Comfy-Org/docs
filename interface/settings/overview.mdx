This section covers detailed setting descriptions in the ComfyUI frontend settings menu. All user settings are automatically saved to the `ComfyUI/user/default/comfy.settings.json` file.

You can use the `Ctrl + ,` keyboard shortcut to open the settings panel, then click on the corresponding setting options to configure them.

Since custom nodes can also register corresponding setting categories in the menu, our official documentation currently only includes native setting content. Additionally, some setting options are **only effective for ComfyUI Desktop**, which we have noted on the corresponding pages.
