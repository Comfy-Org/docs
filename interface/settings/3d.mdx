This section of settings is mainly used to control the initialization settings of 3D-related components in ComfyUI, including camera, lighting, scene, etc. When creating new 3D components, they will be initialized according to these settings. After creation, these settings can still be adjusted individually.

## Camera
  
### Initial Camera Type
- **Options**:   
  - `perspective`  
  - `orthographic` 
- **Function**: Controls whether the default camera is perspective or orthographic when creating new 3D components. This default setting can still be switched individually for each component after creation  

## Light

### Light Adjustment Increment
- **Default Value**: 0.5  
- **Function**: Controls the step size when adjusting light intensity in 3D scenes. Smaller step values allow for finer light adjustments, while larger values make each adjustment more noticeable  

### Light Intensity Minimum
- **Default Value**: 1  
- **Function**: Sets the minimum light intensity value allowed in 3D scenes. This defines the lowest brightness that can be set when adjusting the lighting of any 3D control  

### Light Intensity Maximum
- **Default Value**: 10  
- **Function**: Sets the maximum light intensity value allowed in 3D scenes. This defines the upper limit of brightness that can be set when adjusting the lighting of any 3D control  
  

### Initial Light Intensity
- **Default Value**: 3  
- **Function**: Sets the default brightness level of lights in 3D scenes. This value determines the intensity with which lights illuminate objects when creating new 3D controls, but each control can be adjusted individually after creation  
  

## Scene
  
### Initial Background Color    
- **Function**: Controls the default background color of 3D scenes. This setting determines the background appearance when creating new 3D components, but each component can be adjusted individually after creation  
- **Default Value**: `282828` (dark gray)  
  
### Initial Preview Visibility
- **Function**: Controls whether the preview screen is displayed by default when creating new 3D components. This default setting can still be toggled individually for each component after creation  
- **Default Value**: true (enabled)  
  
### Initial Grid Visibility
- **Function**: Controls whether the grid is displayed by default when creating new 3D components. This default setting can still be toggled individually for each component after creation  
- **Default Value**: true (enabled)
