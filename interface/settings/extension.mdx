The Extension settings panel is a special management panel in the ComfyUI frontend settings system, specifically used to manage the enable/disable status of frontend extension plugins. Unlike Custom Nodes, this panel is only used to manage frontend extensions registered by custom nodes, not to disable custom nodes themselves.

These frontend extension plugins are used to enhance the ComfyUI experience, such as providing shortcuts, settings, UI components, menu items, and other features.

Extension status changes require a page reload to take effect:
