Nodes 2.0 is now available in the nightly version of ComfyUI. This update transitions the node system from LiteGraph.js Canvas rendering to a Vue-based architecture, unlocking faster iteration and richer interactions.

## Why this change?

The previous Canvas rendering system had become a development bottleneck. Even small UI changes often required deep modifications and could take days to implement. This slowed the ability to respond to community feedback and made node customization difficult for developers.

The new Vue-based system enables:

- **Faster feature development** - UI changes can be implemented more quickly
- **Richer interactions** - Dynamic widgets, expandable nodes, and better components
- **A more flexible foundation** - Better support for future tools and customization

## Current status and known issues

We're actively working on improvements and want to be transparent about current limitations:

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Performance** | Still optimizing toward Canvas-level performance. Certain scenarios may behave differently. |
| **Compatibility** | Some custom nodes may require updates to be fully supported. |
| **Edge cases** | At extreme zoom levels or within very large workflows, minor visual issues may appear. |

We're gathering feedback to prioritize improvements. The LiteGraph.js rendering system remains available, and you can toggle between systems at any time.
