The credit system was added to support the `API Nodes`, as calling closed-source AI models requires token consumption, so proper credit management is necessary. By default, the credits interface is not displayed. Please first log in to your ComfyUI account in `Settings` -> `User`, and then you can view your associated account's credit information in `Settings` -> `Credits`.

ComfyUI will always remain fully open-source and free for local users.
