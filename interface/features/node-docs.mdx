## Built-in node documentation

Documentation for ComfyUI's built-in nodes is maintained in the [embedded-docs repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/embedded-docs). 

**Contributing to built-in node docs:**
- Users can contribute improvements and additions to built-in node documentation
- Submit pull requests to the [embedded-docs repository](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/embedded-docs)
- Help improve documentation quality for the entire ComfyUI community

## Custom node documentation

Custom nodes can also include their own documentation. If you're a custom node developer and want to add documentation for your nodes, see [Node docs](/custom-nodes/help_page) for detailed instructions on how to create rich documentation for your custom nodes.

When custom node authors provide documentation, it will automatically appear in the node docs panel when you select their nodes.
