ComfyUI documentation includes several AI-powered features to help you work more efficiently with the documentation and get assistance when needed.

## AI assistant

The AI assistant allows you to update documentation directly from Slack. You can tell the AI what changes you want to make, and it will create a pull request with your requested modifications.

**To use the AI assistant:**
1. Post your documentation update request in the ComfyUI Slack workspace
2. The AI will process your request and create the necessary changes
3. Review the generated pull request with your changes

This feature is natively supported by Mintlify and makes it easy to keep documentation up-to-date without manually editing files.

## Copy for LLM

The "Copy for LLM" button allows you to copy documentation content in a format optimized for large language models. This makes it easy to share documentation context with AI assistants like ChatGPT or Claude.

**To use Copy for LLM:**
1. Navigate to any documentation page
2. Click the "Copy for LLM" button
3. Paste the copied content into your preferred LLM interface

## Copy into ChatGPT

The "Copy into ChatGPT" button provides a streamlined way to share documentation directly with ChatGPT. This feature is particularly useful for onboarding new users who discover ComfyUI through search engines.

**To use Copy into ChatGPT:**
1. Navigate to any documentation page
2. Click the "Copy into ChatGPT" button
3. The content will be formatted and ready to paste into ChatGPT

These features create a smooth onboarding flow from search engine results to getting started with ComfyUI, as the documentation pages rank well in search results for queries like "best local AI image generation tool".
