<Note>
    The subgraph feature requires ComfyUI frontend version xxxx or later. If you don't see this feature, please refer to: [How to Update ComfyUI](/zh-CN/installation/update_comfyui)
</Note>

A subgraph is a powerful ComfyUI feature that lets you package complex workflows into a single reusable subgraph node, making them easier to manage and share.

Think of a subgraph as a "folder" for your workflow â€“ you can group related nodes together and use the entire collection as one unified subgraph node.

**Use subgraphs to:**
- Simplify complex workflows
- Reuse common node combinations
- Build more efficient workflows with modular components

> PS: A video demonstration will be added here

## Creating a Subgraph

<Steps>
    <Step title="Select nodes">
    Select the nodes you want to group in ComfyUI
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click the subgraph icon">
        ![Subgraph icon](/images/interface/features/subgraph/subgraph_icon.jpg)
        Find the subgraph icon in the toolbar
    </Step>
    <Step title="Subgraph created">
        ![Workflow using subgraph](/images/interface/features/subgraph/workflow_using_subgraph.jpg)
        ComfyUI automatically creates a subgraph based on your selected nodes' inputs and outputs
    </Step>
    <Step title="Customize your subgraph">
        Refer to [Editing Subgraphs](#editing-subgraphs), you can edit and organize the subgraph to create a fully functional node

## Working with Subgraphs

### Basic Operations

Subgraphs work just like regular nodes. You can:
- Change colors and names
- Use bypass to disable
- Apply all standard node operations

### Editing Subgraphs

**To enter edit mode:**
- Double-click the empty area inside the subgraph (not on widgets), or
- Click the subgraph edit button

![Subgraph editing mode](/images/interface/features/subgraph/editing_subgraph.jpg)

**In edit mode you'll see:**

1. **Navigation bar**: Exit the current subgraph and return to the parent level
2. **Input slots**: Internal node inputs exposed to the outside
    - Connect outputs to slots like normal nodes
    - **Right-click** connection points to rename/delete exposed slots
3. **Output slots**: Outputs exposed to the outside (same functionality as input slots)

![Subgraph slots](/images/interface/features/subgraph/subgraph_slot.jpg)

**Working with slots:**
1. **Default slot** (labeled 1): Use this to add new input/output connections
2. **Right-click** existing slots to rename, delete, or disconnect from original nodes

> Note: Slot connections follow standard data type validation rules

### Nested Subgraphs

Create even more complex workflows by nesting subgraphs within subgraphs.

The navigation bar shows your current level and lets you easily move between nested subgraphs.
