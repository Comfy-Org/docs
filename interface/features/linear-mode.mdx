</Note>

Linear Mode is an interaction mode designed for users who prefer simplicity. It strips away node complexity to deliver a streamlined interface, allowing you to focus purely on creation.

## Enabling Linear Mode

To enable Linear Mode:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Settings">
        Go to **Settings** by clicking the gear icon
    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to Keybinding">
        Select **Keybinding** from the settings menu
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set a custom shortcut">
        Set a custom shortcut to toggle between traditional node mode and Linear Mode
    </Step>
</Steps>

Once configured, use your custom shortcut to switch between modes at any time.

## Best practices

Linear Mode exposes all node components in your workflow. For a cleaner experience:

- **Use subgraphs to simplify nodes**: Group related nodes into [subgraphs](/interface/features/subgraph) to reduce clutter
- **Organize before switching**: Clean up your workflow in node mode before switching to Linear Mode
- **Keep workflows modular**: Breaking complex workflows into subgraphs helps maintain focus on creative tasks
