The account system was added to support `API Nodes`, which enable calls to closed-source model APIs, greatly expanding the possibilities of ComfyUI. Since these API calls consume tokens, we have added a corresponding user system.

Currently, we support the following login methods:

- Email login
- Google login
- Github login
- API Key login (for non-whitelisted site authorization)

We will provide relevant login requirements and explanations in this document.

## ComfyUI Version Requirements

You may need to use at least [ComfyUI v0.3.0](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/tag/v0.3.30) to use the account system. Ensure that the corresponding frontend version is at least `1.17.11`. Sometimes the frontend may fail to install and revert to an older version, so please check if the frontend version is greater than `1.17.11` in `Settings` -> `About`.

In some regions, network restrictions may prevent normal access to the login API, causing timeouts or failures. Before logging in, please **ensure that your network environment does not restrict access to the corresponding API**, and make sure you can access sites like Google or Github.

<Tip>
Since we are still in rapid iterative updates, related functions may change. If there are no special circumstances, please try to update to the latest version to get support for relevant functions.
</Tip>

## Network Requirements

To login to ComfyUI account, you must be in a secure network environment:

- Only allow access from `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.
- Do not support using the `--listen` parameter to access the API node through a local network.
- If you are using a non-SSL certificate or a site that does not start with `https`, you may not be able to successfully log in.
- You may not be able to log in on a site that is not in our whitelist (but you can log in using an API Key now).
- Ensure you can connect to our service normally (some regions may require a proxy).

## How to Log In

Log in via `Settings` -> `User`:

  For non-whitelisted sites or LAN environments, you can use API Key login. See the detailed guide in the account login documentation.

## Post-Login Status

After logging in, a login button is displayed in the top menu bar of the ComfyUI interface. You can open the corresponding login interface through this button and log out of the corresponding account in the settings menu.
