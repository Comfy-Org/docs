The account system was added to support `API Nodes`, which enable calls to closed-source model APIs, greatly expanding the possibilities of ComfyUI. Since these API calls consume tokens, we have added a corresponding user system.

Currently, we support the following login methods:

- Email login
- Google login
- Github login
- API Key login (for non-whitelisted site authorization)

We will provide relevant login requirements and explanations in this document.

## ComfyUI Version Requirements

You may need to use at least [ComfyUI v0.3.0](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/tag/v0.3.30) to use the account system. Ensure that the corresponding frontend version is at least `1.17.11`. Sometimes the frontend may fail to install and revert to an older version, so please check if the frontend version is greater than `1.17.11` in `Settings` -> `About`.

In some regions, network restrictions may prevent normal access to the login API, causing timeouts or failures. Before logging in, please **ensure that your network environment does not restrict access to the corresponding API**, and make sure you can access sites like Google or Github.

<Tip>
As we are still rapidly iterating and updating, related features may change. If there are no special circumstances, please try to update to the latest version to access the relevant features.

If this is your first login, please create an account first.

## Logging in with an API Key

Since not all ComfyUI deployments are on our domain authorization whitelist, we have provided API Key login in a recent update (2025-05-10) for logging in through non-whitelisted sites. Below are the steps for logging in with an API Key:

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are there any login device restrictions?">
   We do not restrict login devices. You can log in to your account on any device, but please note that your account information may be accessed by other devices, so do not log in to your account on public devices.

  <Accordion title="Why can't I log in with a LAN IP?">
  We do not currently support logging in via LAN IP because the security of the LAN environment is uncontrollable. Therefore, the current version does not fully support LAN IP login. We may consider handling LAN situations in the future.
  </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Why can't I log in on some websites?">
