The account system was added to support `API Nodes`, which allow calls to closed-source model APIs, greatly expanding the possibilities of ComfyUI. Since the corresponding API calls consume Tokens, we have added a corresponding user system.

Log in through `Settings` -> `User`:

Currently, we support the following login methods:

- Email login
- Google login
- Github login

If this is your first login, please create an account first.

<Tip>
You may need to use at least [ComfyUI v0.3.0](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases/tag/v0.3.30) to use the account system, and ensure that the corresponding front-end version is at least `1.17.11`. Sometimes the front-end may fail to install and revert to an older version, so please check in `Settings` -> `About` to see if the front-end version is greater than `1.17.11`.

In some regions, you may experience login timeouts or failures due to network restrictions preventing normal access to the login API. Before logging in, please **ensure that your network environment does not restrict access to the corresponding API**, and that you can access websites like Google or Github normally.
</Tip>

After logging in, the login button will be displayed in the top menu bar of the ComfyUI interface, and you can open the corresponding login interface through this button. You can also log out of your account in the settings menu.

## Common Questions About Accounts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Are there any restrictions on login devices?">
   We do not impose restrictions on login devices. You can log into your account on any device, but please note that your account information may be accessed by other devices, so do not log into your account on public devices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I access login via LAN IP?">
  Currently, we do not support logging in via LAN IP because the security of LAN environments is uncontrollable. Therefore, the current version does not fully support LAN IP login. In the future, we may consider handling LAN situations appropriately.
