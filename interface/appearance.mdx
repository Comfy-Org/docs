ComfyUI offers flexible appearance customization options that allow you to personalize the interface to your preferences.

## Color Palette System

The primary way to customize ComfyUI's appearance is through the built-in color palette system. This allows you to:

- Switch between preset themes
- Modify specific interface elements
- Create and save your own custom themes
- Export and import theme configurations

### Accessing the Color Palette

1. Click the **Settings** gear icon in the sidebar
2. Select **Appearance** → **Color Palette**

### Preset Themes

ComfyUI comes with several built-in themes:

- Dark Theme (default)
- Light Theme
- Additional themes may be available depending on your ComfyUI version

### Customizing Colors

The color palette system lets you customize virtually every aspect of the interface:

- Node colors and styles
- Background colors
- Text colors and fonts
- Widget appearance
- Connection link colors and styles

### Export/Import Themes

You can save and share your custom themes:

1. **Export**: In the Color Palette settings, click "Export" to save your current theme configuration as a JSON file
2. **Import**: Click "Import" to load a previously saved theme or one shared by the community

### Color Configuration Properties

The color palette allows you to modify many specific properties. Here are some of the most commonly customized elements:

```json
{
  "id": "my-custom-theme",          // Unique identifier for the theme
  "name": "My Custom Theme",        // Display name for the theme
  "colors": {
    "node_slot": {                  // Node connection slot colors by data type
      "CLIP": "#FFD500",            // CLIP model connections
      "IMAGE": "#64B5F6",           // Image data connections
      "LATENT": "#FF9CF9",          // Latent space connections
      "MODEL": "#B39DDB",           // Model connections
      "VAE": "#FF6E6E"              // VAE connections
      // (other ComfyUI data types)
    },
    "litegraph_base": {             // Canvas and graph appearance
      "CLEAR_BACKGROUND_COLOR": "#222",      // Main canvas background
      "NODE_TITLE_COLOR": "#999",            // Node title text color
      "NODE_SELECTED_TITLE_COLOR": "#FFF",   // Selected node title color
      "NODE_DEFAULT_BGCOLOR": "#353535",     // Default node background
      "WIDGET_BGCOLOR": "#222",              // Widget background color
      "LINK_COLOR": "#9A9"                   // Connection link color
      // (other LiteGraph properties)
    },
    "comfy_base": {                 // ComfyUI interface colors
      "fg-color": "#fff",           // Primary text color
      "bg-color": "#202020",        // Main background color
      "comfy-menu-bg": "#353535",   // Menu background color
      "comfy-input-bg": "#222",     // Input field background
      "input-text": "#ddd",         // Input text color
      "border-color": "#4e4e4e"     // Border color
      // (other ComfyUI base properties)
    }
  }
}
```

## Background Image

ComfyUI allows you to set a custom background image for your canvas, providing a more personalized workspace.

### Requirements

- ComfyUI frontend version 1.20.5 or newer

### Setting a Background Image via Settings

1. Click the **Settings** gear icon in the sidebar
2. Go to **Appearance** → **Background Image**
3. You can:
   - Upload an image from your local computer using the upload button
   - Provide a URL to a remote image

### Setting a Background Image from Generated Results

You can also quickly set a generated image as the background:

1. Generate an image using any workflow
2. Find the image in the queue sidebar
3. Right-click on the image
4. Select **Set as Background** from the context menu

This is a convenient way to use your own creations as a background for further work.

## Advanced Customization with user.css

For cases where the color palette doesn't provide enough control, you can use custom CSS via a user.css file. This method is recommended for advanced users who need to customize elements that aren't available in the color palette system.

### Requirements

- ComfyUI frontend version 1.20.5 or newer

### Setting Up user.css

1. Create a file named `user.css` in your ComfyUI user directory (same location as your workflows and settings)
2. Add your custom CSS rules to this file
3. Restart ComfyUI or refresh the page to apply changes

### User Directory Location

<Snippet file="install/user-directory.mdx" />

### CSS Specificity Note

The user.css file is loaded early in the application startup process. Because of this, you may need to use `!important` in your CSS rules to ensure they override the default styles.

### Example user.css Customizations

```css
/* Increase font size in inputs and menus for better readability */
.comfy-multiline-input, .litecontextmenu .litemenu-entry {
    font-size: 20px !important;
}

/* Make context menu entries larger for easier selection */
.litegraph .litemenu-entry,
.litemenu-title {
  font-size: 24px !important; 
}

/* Custom styling for specific elements not available in the color palette */
.comfy-menu {
    border: 1px solid rgb(126, 179, 189) !important;
    border-radius: 0px 0px 0px 10px !important;
    backdrop-filter: blur(2px);
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the color palette** for most customizations
2. Use **user.css only when necessary** for elements not covered by the color palette
3. **Export your theme** before making significant changes so you can revert if needed
4. **Share your themes** with the community to inspire others

## Troubleshooting

- If your color palette changes don't appear, try refreshing the page
- If CSS customizations don't work, check that you're using frontend version 1.20.5+
- Try adding `!important` to user.css rules that aren't being applied
- Keep backups of your customizations to easily restore them
