The Mask Editor is a very useful feature in ComfyUI that allows users to create and edit masks within images without needing to use other applications.

The Mask Editor is currently triggered through the `Load Image` node. After uploading an image, you can right-click on the node and select `Open in MaskEditor` from the menu to open the Mask Editor.
